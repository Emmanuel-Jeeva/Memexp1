That's what makes it symmetrical. But the key needs to stay a secret between the two people which is why this is sometimes also called\u00a0secret key cryptography. Symetric crytogroophy is good for keeping information confidential.     -Asymmetric cryptography -In asymmetric cryptography, each participant has\u00a0two\u00a0keys. One is public and is sent to anyone the party wishes to communicate with. That's the key used to encrypt messages. But the other key is private, shared with nobody, and it's necessary to decrypt those messages.The computations needed for asymmetric cryptography are much more complex and resource intensive that those behind symmetric infrastructure. -Cryptography is now more important than ever allowing people to keep information safe - I chose these two articles because I thought that they would help further learning about cryptology and cryptography which I believe may be more useful once we get to the history of the internet</p>"},{"location":"Emmanuels%20Personal%20Memex/Index/Cryptogrophy/Substitution%20ciphers/","title":"Substitution ciphers","text":"<p>\u201cSubstitution Cipher.\u201d 2019.

Within the first article of this part of my journey the @Gitelman-Source Note it was made clear the groups of people were excluded from history as I learned that from Gitelman that \"history has asumptions and biases towards what some consider important vs unimportant.\" When I learned that groups of media try to appeal to whatever is most popular this made me realise that pretty much whoever was not in power at the time was not going to be written into history and that this was why lot of history is written from similar perspectives. </p> <p>The @As We May Think-Source Note progresses the leaning from gitelman's note as it talks about the internet and how the internets vision was never fully realised. I believe that if we got the truly dynamic version of the internet that was envisioned wouldve helped allow groups of people who werent allowed to have a voice to speak out a lot earlier and might have an impact on things such as racism,misogny and homophobia but instead the internet was made in  way that only certain people could have a voice for a long time.</p> <p>The article @The Birth of the Modem World shows a side of the internet that isnt highlighted as much by the mainstream media as it was more for enthusiastes. However the BBS's were useful as they managed to singlehandedly make a new space on the internet where people could voice their own opinion and could communicate freely allowing new communities of people who were often marginalised to embrace their similarities and come together. By coming together they finally were able to slowly change the tides and work to end oppresion or gain equality/ equal rights. This is what I consider to be a showcase of why I believe the turning of oppression through the internet is the most powerful thing in the course that we learned about as it shows how the internet can make real change in the world even if it starts out in small communities.</p> <p>The final step in this part of the journey ends with Pam Hardt . I believe that Pam showcases the power that the internet had as it gave women a chance to finally be represented and treated as equals.

I believe that my journey starting at the @As We May Think-Source Note was the start of this. With this we got to learn about ideas and concepts that could have been made possible throught the internet. While I initialy simply looked at this reading at its face value I believe now that it shows the emergence of the modern concept of cutting content or ideas which is something programers and people of work in other fields have to deal with. Whether an idea may be not feasible, too difficult, too controverial or not popular enough there are many reasons why things may be changed or downsized especially within the computer science industry where certain programs,applications or pieces of entertainment end up with less features or imporvments over time.  </p> <p>The next part of this journey was the @The Science of Computing article which I recently got to read through. Within this article I learned about ARPANET which I believe to be importnent as they programmed what was essentially the template for the internet we now know today. By learning about this I was able to expand my own ideas of what computer science is useful for as I previously only looked at programming things such as software,computers and security versus what the people at ARPANET were able to do by programming the entire precursor to the internet. Thanks to this newfound knowledge  I now know the roots of networking and who started programming what essentially was the internet.</p> <p>My journey then reflects back on Alexander Grahm Bell. Throughout this course and especially within the second and third memex check in's I looked at people who influecned the history of the internet as well as the world in some major way and one of these figures was Alexander Graham Bell.  Alexander Graham Bell has shown me the importance of the technology that came before the internet and how it shaped our modern culture. It also showed me how even back then people wanted to create accesible technology which is a goal of many companies/ programmers today as it allows more people to use whatever you or your team creates. </p> <p>The last article that was part of my journey was the impact of Alan Turing which I believe had been able to help me come to the end of my journey over these four months. Alan turing was essentially the father of computer science and his dedication to the field helped change the war. Alan Turing helped me to understand how computer science can help people and change lives as well as helped educate me on the roots for computer science. I believe that his story also helped complete my memex as it helped add another important individual to my memex and helped centralise my theme of people and their impact on both the internet and the world.</p> <p>In conclusion my journey across this semester from @As We May Think-Source Note all the way to @The Impact of Alan Turing was able to help me learn more about the history of computer science, its origins as well as how plans for certain projects can change over time. I believe that this journey has helped me to now have a firm understanding of how important computer science is and how it can be used to make a positive difference in the world by making more accessible technology.</p>"},{"location":"Emmanuels%20Personal%20Memex/Index/FInal%20Journey/0_Final%20Journey_2/#the-journey-between-websiteemmanuels-personal-memexindexsource-notesas-we-may-think-source-note-and-websiteemmanuels-personal-memexindexsource-notesthe-impact-of-alan-turing","title":"The Journey Between website/Emmanuels Personal Memex/Index/Source notes/@As We May Think-Source Note and website/Emmanuels Personal Memex/Index/Source notes/@The Impact of Alan Turing","text":"<ul> <li>website/Emmanuels Personal Memex/Index/Source notes/@As We May Think-Source Note</li> <li>website/Emmanuels Personal Memex/Index/Source notes/@The Science of Computing</li> <li>website/Emmanuels Personal Memex/Index/people and their impact/Alexander Graham Bell</li> <li>website/Emmanuels Personal Memex/Index/Source notes/@The Impact of Alan Turing</li> </ul>"},{"location":"Emmanuels%20Personal%20Memex/Index/Internet%20Impact/BBS/","title":"BBS #memex3 #internet","text":"<p>Zydyk, Marisuz. \"bulletin board system.\" Whatis.com.

That being said their were still certain individuals who were still important to look at individually such as Pam Hardt. I could also finally look at the subtheme of impact/legacy as many individuals from previous memex's were now having their goals or worldviews being brought to light The BBS was able to let all kinds of communities who were previously marginalized to be able to stand together and people like Alexander Graham Bell were brough back into articles as their ideas and concepts were still considered relevant and their visions finally brought into fruition.

It is made up of two halves; cryptography consists of the techniques for creating systems of secret writingCryptology and Cryptography + the Internet and cryptanalysis encompasses the techniques of breaking them.\"</p> <p>The reading talks about cryptology and its history. It starts by discussing how the military,government and people in buisness always try to keep their writing secret ever since they started writing. However unlike ohter forms of secret writing what makes cryptology so unique is that they dont hide the precesnce of a secret message but rather they make the message impossible to read to the averag person. The reading then talks about how cryptoanalysts try to look at the science of cryptography.</p> <p></p> <p>The second half of the reading talks about codes and ciphers. A code will take the form of a book where numerical or alphabetical codeword is switched with words or phrases. Commercial codes are used by telegraphy companies in the 19th and 20th century. Cryptoanalyzing these codes is difficult since often theres no logical connection between the codeword and the plaintext it represents.  In many cases where codes are used, the encoded message is then also enciphered so the codewords are enciphered when the message is transmitted which is known as superencipherment. Ciphers also transform plaintext into ciphertext, but unlike codes, ciphers use small, \ue01exed-length language elements that are divorced from the meaning of the word or phrase in the message. There are two types of cyphers.Substitution ciphers will replace each letter in a message with a different letter or symbol using a mapping called a cipher alphabet. The second type will rearrange the letters of a message, but will not substitute new letters for the existing letters in the message. These are transposition ciphers.</p>"},{"location":"Emmanuels%20Personal%20Memex/Index/Source%20notes/%40History%20of%20Cryptography%20and%20Cryptanalysis-Source%20Note/#page-notes","title":"Page Notes","text":""},{"location":"Emmanuels%20Personal%20Memex/Index/Source%20notes/%40History%20of%20Cryptography%20and%20Cryptanalysis-Source%20Note/#highlights","title":"Highlights","text":"<ul> <li>computing, with an emphasis on the \u2018externalist\u2019 view of this history, more accessible to a wider audience.

Although BBS-to-BBS message networks were common, each system still felt like its own island culture with a tin-pot dictator (the system operator\u2014or \"sysop\" for short) who lorded over anyone who visited. - I believe this helps show how niche and small the internet was before the events of the Mar 29 lecture where google starts pumping ads and websites become about selling products</p> <p>-I explored several BBS software options. At my dad's or Doug's suggestion, I tried Procomm Plus's built-in host mode, which was very bare-bones and unappealing. I also used a separate program called \"Minihost,\" which was a minimal BBS package. - I highlighted this as I think it helps give context to how BBS packages worked/ how there was options</p> <p>-The last day of the original Cave BBS was February 9, 1998. I was in 11th grade, about to turn 17 years old. I remember waking up one morning, checking the BBS, and noticing that a memory leak (which was common with BBS door games) had crashed the BBS again. Instead of resetting it, I decided to just take it offline. I held no ceremony and shed no tears; it just felt like time to hang up the ol' BBS and move on. - This in my opionion is a significant moment as it shows how many others BBS might have been taken offline due to technical errors eventually killing this aspect of the internet permantly - I believe that this also relates to Eric Desrosiers memex https://glng3r.github.io/memex/Faxed%20Coopersmith/%40coopersmithFaxedRiseFall2015%20source/  where he talks about \"Coopersmith does this in order to show that even if you have a useful technology, if it does not make sense economically than it is a failed invention.\" and this concept of having a technology that fails but even though it failed it helps create a new technology.</p>"},{"location":"Emmanuels%20Personal%20Memex/Index/Source%20notes/%40Telecommunications%20and%20Colonial%20Rivalry/","title":"@Telecommunications and Colonial Rivalry","text":"<p>Quevedo, Javier M\u00e1rquez. \u201cTelecommunications and Colonial Rivalry: European Telegraph Cables to the Canary Islands and Northwest Africa, 1883-1914.\u201d Historical Social Research / Historische Sozialforschung 35, no. 1 (131) (2010): 108\u201324. http://www.jstor.org/stable/20762431.

This mismatch reflects the uncertain definition of \u201cthe internet.\u201d When nonexperts look for internet origin stories, they want to know about the internet as they know it, the internet they carry around in their pockets, the internet they turn to, day after day - I believe this links back to our course were in the initial lectures we we looking for alternate perspectives such as multiple countries during the telephone era as well as learning about women's perspective during the history of the computer. Things such as these are important for people to learn about since they still are apart of the history and help give a more complete picture. - This also links to Sophies memex https://probablyanxious.github.io/hist1900-memex/Source%20Notes/When%20Computers%20Were%20Women/ where she says \"Light works to illuminate the erasure of women in the history of computing in the article\u00a0When Computers Were Women, and how this erasure perpetuates the notion that women are unfit or uninterested in STEM fields to this day. This article explores how the work of women in the field of computing was minimized despite its complexity and significance.\" since this was a sort of turn around point where women could slowly show their intrests in things such as computers or the internet even if it wasnt exactly in broad daylight. -Because they foreshadowed the intensely personal and interactive blogs, forums, and social media platforms that emerged later, exploring how these communities developed and sustained themselves not only provides a fuller history of the internet, but offers insights into how we might build healthier online communities that are more just, equitable, and inclusive. - I believe this highlights why the BBS is important as now communication and being able to voice your opinions freely with others is major reason why the internet is very popular and also has helped shape the world and change many aspects of societies and cultures. -At the core of this history is a rather strange peripheral: the dial-up modem. In the 1980s, \u201cmodem\u201d referred to a device for converting a stream of digital pulses from a computer into an audible signal for transmission over a standard telephone line, allowing computers to relay information via telephone. - I highlighted this as it shows how even the BBS can be related back to Alexander Graham Bell and the telephone as it shows how the BBS is a natural evolution of the telephone. -Early on, most people called in from paper-based teleprinters, but these were soon replaced by PCs with video displays and \u201cterminal emulation\u201d software. - Shows how initially at least the history of computers and the history of the internet went hand in hand. -Thousands of readers did, and soon new bulletin boards were being announced around North America and Europe. Each new BBS tweaked the core concept of the computerized bulletin board, adding features for trading files or playing games, implementing rules regarding user behavior, and expressing the local culture and personality of its owners. Most were free to use, save for the cost of placing a long-distance call. - I believe that each BBS being able to be tweaked to be exactly the way the users wanted it to be this goes back to @As We May Think-Source Note where the internet was suppossed to be much  more interavtive letting each user create their own \"Garden\". -In movie theaters, the Cold War thriller WarGames showed its two young protagonists using a modem and microcomputer to change their grades, download games, and almost start World War III. It was the first time that Hollywood had depicted computers and computer networks as tools of exploration, play, personal identity, and teen mischief. Over the next year, BBSs and commercial services alike saw a surge in new users as teens attached modems to their home computers  - I highlighted this as it goes into WarGames which was discussed in the Mar 20 lecture -No such luck for rural users: If you were the only amateur astronomer in your area, there might not be anyone on the local boards for you to chat with. - Find it interesting that people living in rural areas still have issues with internet even if they arent nearly as bad. -On average, the demographics of the modem world fit the stereotype of the 1980s computer geek: young, white, middle-class males. But as PCs became more common, BBS technology spread beyond enthusiasts to serve other groups of people with a more urgent need for alternative media. By the start of the 1990s, BBS networks organized around shared identities, cultural interests, and political commitments had become especially vibrant spaces for socializing, organizing, and sharing resources. - From my perspective this seems like the birth of the modern internet in terms of being able to find communities that have shared interests/beleifs as well as more women in tech fields such as Pam Hardt. -Forgetting has high stakes. As the internet becomes the compulsory infrastructure of everyday life, the stories we tell about its origins are more important than ever. - I think this more highlights how important it is for us to educate people on things such as the BBS so that way we dont forget.</p>"},{"location":"Emmanuels%20Personal%20Memex/Index/Source%20notes/%40The%20Impact%20of%20Alan%20Turing/","title":"@The Impact of Alan Turing","text":"<p>https://books-scholarsportal-info.proxy.library.carleton.ca/uri/ebooks/ebooks4/springer4/2019-07-01/2/9783030176013 Bowen, Jonathan P., Zhiming Liu, and Zili Zhang.\u00a0Engineering Trustworthy Software Systems: 4th International School, SETSS 2018, Chongqing, China, April 7\u201312, 2018, Tutorial Lectures.

He talks about how the telephone wasnt gaining the popularity it was originaly suppossed to but with the help of some other investors the company of Bell was able to gain mainstream attention and appeal to the mass groups of people  making the telephone a piece of technology that was able to innovate on itself. It also discusses Western Union and how they tried to compete with Bell which was also disccussed in the Feb 27 lecture however Western Union wasnt trying to get the telegraph into the averag persons hands which led to Bell's success. I chose this article to be a source as I felt that it was able to convey the importance of what Bell wanted with the telephone while also showcasing the surrounding world with companies such as western union and their impact on the telegraph.</p> <p>\"Alexander Graham Bell\u2019s original goal was not to transmit speech, but tomake it visible. Bell was keenly interested in deafness\u2014his mother, Eliza,and future wife, Mabel, were both deaf\u2014and he considered the educationof the deaf his principal purpose in life.\" - I highlighted this as I found it interesting how a goal to make something more accessible can lead to creating something else entirely similar to what Dr.Graham was talking about in the lecture where the internet was suppossed to be something where anybody can edit or comment on any articlesimilar to our memexs but instead ended up becoming more like a digital library.</p> <p>\"The telephone did make speech visible, just not in the way Bell hadimagined. For what is a telephone wire but a visible conduit for humanspeech?\" - I highlighted this because I think it goes to show how the telephone is more than just a way to contact others but is a way to make our speech visible - To link to Briannas memex in the Cataloguing as a Portal note where they said \"The use of the word portal really describes how modern digitalized cataloguing feels. We search up a topic we're looking for an we're immediately greeted by sources related to our search. Clicking on the link instantly transports us to that source of information.\" I felt that a similar thing happened with the initial telephone in a sense that it became a \"portal\" for speech and communication. https://briannalegros.github.io/personalmemextest/Cataloguing%20as%20a%20Portal/</p> <p>\"The U.S. Postal Service was by the late nineteenthcentury a true mass medium, more extensive and accessible than the postalsystem of any other country, and seen by most Americans as a crucial democratic good. The telegraph, by contrast, was the child and agent of privatebusiness.\" - Goes back to one of the earlier lectures, the postal services was a form of media that was able to have a social influnce on the people which was eventually replaced by the telegraph and then telephone.</p> <p>\"Debates around the telephone in the 1870s, 1880s, and 1890s oftenresembled earlier debates about the telegraph and the mails, just as they anticipated later discourse surrounding radio, television, and the In-ternet.\" - Goes to show that the telegraph really is a predecessor of the internet and that both are able to create the same types of debates.</p> <p>\"only in dire circumstances would ordinary Americans have cause to send or receive a telegram.\" - relates to @The Rise and The Fall of the Fax Machine where it was said that \"Thebest technology is worthless if it is too costly to be used.\" I believe that the telegraph and the telephone were held back by the economy and that this will inevitably repeat with the internet.</p> <p>\"Western Union was the first American company of any kind to forge anational monopoly out of what had previously been a competitive industry.After absorbing the United States Telegraph Company and the AmericanTelegraph Company in 1866, Western Union controlled perhaps 90 percentof the telegraph market in the United States.\" - This was talked about in the lectures but while western union controlled the telegraph it gives Bell the ability to control telephones</p> <p>\"What Hubbard wanted from Bell was not a telephone. What Hubbard wanted, like everyone else in the industry, was a quadruplex or multiplex telegraph, a device that could transmit four or more messages simultane-ously over a single wire. Bell\u2019s idea was to construct a \u2018\u2018harmonic telegraph\u2019\u2019that could send different messages using different musical notes.\" - This conflict of ideas is important as I feel like it highlights issues that proceed to haunt the telephones success</p> <p>\"In the choices he made, we can see his determination to make the telephone a\u2018\u2018telegraph for the people,\u2019\u2019 an alternative to Western Union and the accu-mulation of wealth and corporate power it had come to represent.\" - I believe that the social idea of a telegraph for the people is an important one as it realtes to the concept of creating a garden via the internet from Caufield and being able to give everyone a voice/ chance to voice their opinion versus what Western Union wanted.</p> <p>\"His earliest promotional material stressed what he saw as the telephone\u2019s chief advantages over the telegraph:it was simple enough to be used by anyone; it required no knowledge ofMorse code; and it admitted no third parties, in the form of telegraph clerksor messengers, into private communications.\" - This accesiblilty is something that I believe is important. Trying to take an already existing concept and making it more usable is important in my opinion. I also find it interesting that there was so much inovation in this period in comparrison to @Kumar From Clay Tablets to Web-Source Note where the libraries didnt recieve to much conceptual inovation but rather just inovated on how they were presented.</p> <p>\"While Hubbard had hoped to make the telephone a telegraph for the people, the Forbes group preferred to concentrate on the wealthiest seg-ment of the market. The telephone, as Forbes and his colleagues saw it, did not belong to the people. It was not meant to be an answer to monopolyor a new mass medium.\" - This is an unfortunate thing that happens to a lot of inventions and makes me wonder if anything of a similar sort ends up happening to the internet</p> <p>\"They were men of means, who could afford topay over a hundred dollars per year for service at a time when that repre-sented more than a quarter of the average worker\u2019s annual wage.\" - Where are women in this? Curious to see if they had any say in the telegraph or telephone.</p> <p>\"More dramatic proof of the changes at Bell Telephone came in Novem-ber 1879, when Forbes signed a contract with Western Union, ending competition and the patent battle between the two firms.\" - This was discussed in class during Feb 27  but this in a way helped the telephone so I felt it was important to highlight</p> <p>\"These technological systems seemed to offer arguments fo rthe ideal of system itself\u2014for the standardization of procedures, the consol-idation of ownership, and the centralization of control. \u2018\u2018A railway, like a vast machine, the wheels of which are all connected with each other . . .requires a certain harmony, and cannot be worked by a number of inde-pendent agents,\u2019\u2019 declared one 1850 treatise on the economy of railways.\u2018\u2018The organization of a railway requires unity of direction and harmony of movement, which can only be attained by the combination of the entirecarrying business with the general administration of the road.\u2019\u201970 Vail wouldecho this language all his life.\" - I highlighted this as I find the railroad analogy to be a smart one. Reminds me of the garden analogy in Caufield and how that can be used to convey an idea.</p> <p>\"If Forbes and Hubbard had any-thing in common, it was that both men saw the telephone as a means tosome end. For Vail, the telephone network was an end in itself. What inter-ested him most was neither profit nor the people, but rather the organiza-tion and expansion of the system.\" - This intrigues me as the expansion of the telephone from my perspective would theretically still make the telephone the mean to an end.</p> <p>\"The operating companies valued their independence from American Bell and resisted attempts by the parent firm to control or direct their operations.\" - I beleive that this is important and that every company should to some degree try to value their independance as it creates competition in that market</p> <p>\"The name of the new company suggested one more goal. Vail ultimatelyhoped to unify all wire communications in America\u2014both telephone andtelegraph\u2014under one company\u2019s control.\" - I feel like this is inheritly an actually good thing as it could lead to the telephone and telgraph becoming bigger and reach all groups of people</p> <p>\"The telephone did not become an instrument of the people. By 1893,there were only 266,000 telephones in the entire United States, or approxi-mately one telephone for every 250 people.\" - This result was unfortunate and I feel like this contributed to less disscussion created around social/political issues back it the 1800s as there was less communication between people who lived farther away from each other which probably slowed progress down.</p> <p>\"One thing that Forbes and Hubbard both seemed to understand wasthat ideas about the telephone were inescapably political. They involvedarguments about monopoly and competition, about national and localcommerce, and about the proper scale of business and social life.\" - A lot of things and inovations are inheretly going to have some degree of politicalness involved. For example @History of Cryptography and Cryptanalysis-Source Note shows how cryptology ends up being used by governments and military to keep political secrets.</p>"},{"location":"Emmanuels%20Personal%20Memex/Index/Source%20notes/%40The%20Rise%20and%20The%20Fall%20of%20the%20Fax%20Machine/","title":"@The Rise and The Fall of the Fax Machine","text":"<p>Coopersmith, Jonathan. 2015.

The author also showcases how the Fax Machine slowly grew as well as the affordability issues with the fax machine. I believe that this book is important as we can see the similarities between the fax machine and many other types of modern technology hence why I believe the people behind each new technology need to make them more viable for the general public to use so that they will stay relevant.</p> <p>In an age of instantaneous information and images, it is hard to appreciate themagic that millions in the 1930s experienced upon seeing photographs of distantdisasters appear the next day in their newspapers, or the excitement in the 1980s ofwatching an exact copy of a letter emerge line by line from a machine connectedto the telephone network.</p> <p>-I agree as I find a lot of older forms of communication are taken for granted.</p> <p>The basic concept of a facsimile, or fax machine\u2014a machine that electricallytransmits an image\u2014has not changed since 1843.

What did change was the practical realization of those advantages asembodied in actual machines and experienced not in isolation but in the contextof evolving competitors, comparative economic calculations, and societal expec-tations about communications as various meanings, standards, markets, techno-logical capabilities, and societal demands changed.</p> <ul> <li> <p>The gap between inflated expectations and technological and commercial fea-sibility also contributed to faxing\u2019s continuing failures.</p> </li> <li> <p>The hope of hitting the Next Big Thing induced governments, organizations,firms, and individuals to invest.</p> </li> <li> <p>The changing capabilities and economics of fax technology laid the foun-dations for changing concepts of its applications and users</p> </li> <li> <p>The fax machine may not automatically be associated with the study of vi-sual culture, but faxing\u2019s ability to replicate and reproduce images, repeatedly ifneeded, over distance and time made the technology an important actor in cre-ating the modern and postmodern worlds.

Hewrote of \"a species of lodestone which possesses such virtue, that if twoneedles be touched with it, and then balanced on separate pivots, and theone turned in a particular direction, the other will sympathetically moveparallel to it.\" Each needle, he explained, was to be mounted in the centerof a dial, with the letters of the alphabet written around its edge.</p> <p>The story of the needles was based on a germ of truth: There are indeednaturally occurring minerals, known as lodestones, which can be used tomagnetize needles and other metallic objects. And if two magnets are placedon pivots very close together, moving one will indeed cause the other tomove in response, as a result of the interaction of their magnetic fields. Butit is not the case that the two magnets will always remain parallel, and theeffect is only noticeable when they are right next to each other.</p> <p>-I highligted this because it shows how a lot of old stories have hidden truths</p> <p>If a message could be passed along a network of three towers successfully, thesystem would obviously work with a larger number of towers over greaterdistances. Following the Chappe brothers' run-in with the Paris mob, themayors of each of the three towns were made responsible for the safety ofthe telegraphs and their operators.</p> <p>THE TELEGRAPH SYSTEM was rightly regarded as a technologicalwonder of its time. An entry in the 1797 edition of the EncyclopaediaBritannica strikes a note of technological optimism that sounds familiartoday: \"The capitals of distant nations might be united by chains of posts,and the settling of those disputes which at present take up months or yearsmight then be accomplished in as many hours.\"</p> <p>-I highlighted this because I found it Interesting how now Britannica is sow entirely on the internet wheras before it was used to report on the progress that would lead towards the internet</p> <p>He faced increasing criticism from rival inventors, who claimed eitherto have invented superior forms of telegraph or to have had the idea for thetelegraph before him. Even his former associate, the clock maker Breguet,turned against him and claimed to have contributed far more to Chappe'sdesign than simply the control mechanism.</p> <p>-Highlighted because it Relates back to the lecture when Dr.Graham talked about how women probably are not given enough credit for what they have done in terms of creating the internet.</p> <p>The earliest suggestion of a scheme for using electricity to send messageshad appeared in the Scots' Magazine of February 17, 1753</p> <p>One example of a working electric telegraph was constructed in 1816 by atwenty-eight-year-old Englishman, Francis Ronalds. Similar to Chappe'soriginal design, it involved synchronized clocks whose dials were markedwith letters, rather like the dials supposedly used with the sympatheticneedles. Instead of hands, each clock had a rotating disk with a notch cutinto it so that only one of the letters on the dial was visible at any time.</p> <p>uLTIMATELY, the success of the optical telegraph designs inspired byChappe was limited because they were so expensive to run.</p> <p>-highlighted because it Goes back to the @The Rise and The Fall of the Fax Machine where it was stated that the tech can roll out faster if it is more economically viable.</p>"},{"location":"Emmanuels%20Personal%20Memex/Index/pre%20computer/The%20Victorian%20Internet%20Chapter%205/","title":"The Victorian Internet Chapter 5","text":"<p>Standage, Tom. 1998.
