#overview #memex3 

For the final Memex while the theme is still people and their impact I ended up that coming to a realisation that history is made up more than just individual people but also groups of people who are typically underrepresented. While in my previous memex I discussed some women in the history om cputers and their impact with the history of the internet itself there was many more groups of people such as the many different groups who had their own BBS's as well as the group who worked on ARPANET. That being said their were still certain individuals who were still important to look at individually such as Pam Hardt. I could also finally look at the subtheme of impact/legacy as many individuals from previous memex's were now having their goals or worldviews being brought to light The BBS was able to let all kinds of communities who were previously marginalized to be able to stand together and people like Alexander Graham Bell were brough back into articles as their ideas and concepts were still considered relevant and their visions finally brought into fruition. I think that all the concepts in this final part of the memex can even relate back to the first part where the concept of making a "Garden" or taking good notes were all made by people who had passion for what they did just like the groups of people and the individuals of memex 3
