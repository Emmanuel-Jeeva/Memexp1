## Highlights 

> Pamela Hardt-English grew up in the midst of the women’s rights movements. It was still very common at that time for women to go from high school to becoming housewives but Pamela wanted more. She wanted to be able to take care of herself instead of having to rely on someone else.

- I highlighted this as it helps the reader understand that Pam Hardt grew up in a very different age where scoiety wasstill not letting women have equal oppurtunities to men in the workplace.

> During this time period, Pamela learned about Project One located in San Francisco. This was a warehouse community (aka a live-work community) that supported the counterculture movement. It was a compound that housed things like technology organizations and artists. There was even a high school and daycare in the compound where children were taught in a free way of thinking.

- This was what we learned about in the [[Mar 15]] lecture 
> Within the walls of Project One and in the project of Resource One, women weren’t limited to what they could do by traditional gender roles at the time. Everyone pitched in to accomplish what needed to be done whether it was building a wall or raising necessary funds.

- I believe that things like this are important because they serve as a foundation for modern movements such as women in Stem.
