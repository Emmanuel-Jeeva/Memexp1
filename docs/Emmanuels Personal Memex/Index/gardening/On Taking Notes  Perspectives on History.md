*Even though this article was apart of its own lecture I ended up relating it back to [[Caufield]] as I found it to help with the memx building process

## Page Notes
## Highlights
- Before going to the archives, I try to read in advance the secondary literature on my research topics, including popular histories, for two reasons. I need to know the received narratives about my historical subject and master a lot of historical detail. — [Updated on 2023-02-07 13:59:53](https://hyp.is/msooSqcZEe2KAIde4Onh6g/www.historians.org/research-and-publications/perspectives-on-history/january-2009/on-taking-notes) — Group: #hist1900c-w2023
	- I think its important to try and gain some sort of context before reading something. With a lot of class notes the lectures serve as a very broad way to gain context on some of the concepts in the readings or other articles that we are interested.

- I arrive, equipped with a laptop computer, a battery and plugs, an external hard drive with many gigabytes of storage space, and a digital camera with at least one extra battery and a cable connection to the computer. — [Updated on 2023-02-07 14:00:10](https://hyp.is/pQIarKcZEe2_2xs6hLpsKA/www.historians.org/research-and-publications/perspectives-on-history/january-2009/on-taking-notes) — Group: #hist1900c-w2023
	- Important to be prepared for taking notes in person and to always have the right tools

- I then take careful summary notes of what seem to be the most significant documents, with careful attention to their place in the sequence of the file, how much space they take up, and their rhetorical ordering and sequencing. — [Updated on 2023-02-07 14:00:21](https://hyp.is/q4q_HqcZEe2p3qtx0dUu_w/www.historians.org/research-and-publications/perspectives-on-history/january-2009/on-taking-notes) — Group: #hist1900c-w2023
	- Applicable to the memex and to the course in my opion. Trying to figure out what articles are significant enough for a source note versus what would simply be an idea note. Also where they will go in the final memex
- After all these maneuvers, my texts do not write themselves. I still have to engage in trial and error and multiple redrafts. I keep redrafting outlines.
	- This is very true for my memex. Constantly deleting stuff that is not importnt/ doesnt connect with what I would like to be the final product.
