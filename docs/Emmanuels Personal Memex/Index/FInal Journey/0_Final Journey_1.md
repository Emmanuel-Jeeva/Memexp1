Q1
In this course there were many things that we learned about that I could consider "powerful" however the thing that I consider the most powerful is the breakthrough of different groups who were previously excluded from history such as women being able to finally get represented within history even if it wasnt to a large extent. Within the first article of this part of my journey the [[@Gitelman-Source Note]] it was made clear the groups of people were excluded from history as I learned that from Gitelman that "history has asumptions and biases towards what some consider important vs unimportant." When I learned that groups of media try to appeal to whatever is most popular this made me realise that pretty much whoever was not in power at the time was not going to be written into history and that this was why lot of history is written from similar perspectives. 


The [[@As We May Think-Source Note]] progresses the leaning from gitelman's note as it talks about the internet and how the internets vision was never fully realised. I believe that if we got the truly dynamic version of the internet that was envisioned wouldve helped allow groups of people who werent allowed to have a voice to speak out a lot earlier and might have an impact on things such as racism,misogny and homophobia but instead the internet was made in  way that only certain people could have a voice for a long time.

The article [[@The Birth of the Modem World]] shows a side of the internet that isnt highlighted as much by the mainstream media as it was more for enthusiastes. However the BBS's were useful as they managed to singlehandedly make a new space on the internet where people could voice their own opinion and could communicate freely allowing new communities of people who were often marginalised to embrace their similarities and come together. By coming together they finally were able to slowly change the tides and work to end oppresion or gain equality/ equal rights. This is what I consider to be a showcase of why I believe the turning of oppression through the internet is the most powerful thing in the course that we learned about as it shows how the internet can make real change in the world even if it starts out in small communities.


The final step in this part of the journey ends with [[Pam Hardt]] . I believe that Pam showcases the power that the internet had as it gave women a chance to finally be represented and treated as equals. Pam shows the progression of society and the breakthrough of women into not only science fields but also the ability for them to finally get some credit in our history.

In conclusion I believe that the journey from [[@Gitelman-Source Note]] to [[Pam Hardt]] showcases the power that the internet was able to give to groups or communities who were previously considered oppresed and constantly erased from history not only giving them a voice but also letting them leave their mark on history which I believe showcases the power of the internet and the good aspects of the internet.
