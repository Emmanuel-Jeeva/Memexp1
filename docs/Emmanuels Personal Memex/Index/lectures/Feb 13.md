-   we've seen how lots of techs exist as _assemblages_
-   assemblages can be thought of as _complex systems_
-   in the right conditions, complex systems can _evolve_
- Wiring things correctly can make feedback loops

-   And having won out, what did it teach us about _networks_ powered by _electricity_?
    
-   For that, we need a framework that helps us identify the _why_ of the story. Points us towards historical theory
    
-   History is a _verb_, an inquiry; we inquire to understand _why_ 
- History is a tool to make sense of the past

**what if we have two trains on the line at once?**
within a decade, hundreds of miles built
problem of communicating when the line is clear now pressing
	1838 Edward Davy
	1838 William Cooke and Charles Wheatstone
	These two made the connection between galvonmeter and not wanting crashing trains


Morse learned that it would be easier to use leetrs instead of code
