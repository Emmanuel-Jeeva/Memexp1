-Cryptology systems for secret writing have existed for a long time
-Cryptology existed in multiple cultures


*general advice*
-Draw out the 'assemblage' of ideas that makes that story intelligible. What things must come together for such a story to have happened?



-Sometimes when decyphering something the pattern is the key

a code: 'variable sized elements that have meaning in the plaintext language' - syllables, words, phrases (Dooley, 5); thousands of substitutions

a cipher: a transformation from plaintext according to some transformation (Dooley, 5-6); 'small fixed number of substitution elements'

*On Extracting Obscured Correspondence*

One way to solve an encrypted message, if we know its language, is to find a different plaintext of the same language long enough to fill one sheet or so, and then we count the occurrences of each letter. We call the most frequently occurring letter the "first", the next most occurring letter the "second", the following most occurring letter the "third", and so on, until we account for all the different letters in the plaintext sample. Then we look at the cipher text we want to solve and we also classify its symbols. We find the most occurring symbol and change it to the form of the "first" letter of the plaintext sample, the next most common symbol is changed to the form of the "second" letter, and the following most common symbol is changed to the form of the "third" letter, and so on, until we account for all symbols of the cryptogram we want to solve.


Roger Bacon (13th century) describes various systems of secret writing known to him; may also have encrypted the secret of the Philosopher's Stone in the same description using a grille (piece of card with holes cut out, fits over the page, reveals words)
Otherwise, fairly behind

**Early Modern Europe (16th to about 1800 ish)**

-remember, intro of a new information technology in Europe (moveable type) is also a marker for this period
-faster circulation of ideas
-new ideas around relationship of people to God, to each other, nature of government, what is a state, anyway... all these things up for discussion
-coinciding with the European age of discovery too...

**Nomenclators**

mixture of subsitution cyphers and codebooks
still susceptible to frequency analysis and context-dependent guessing
popular in diplomatic circles 1400 - to about 1800
