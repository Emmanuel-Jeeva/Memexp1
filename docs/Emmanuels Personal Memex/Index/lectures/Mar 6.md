_machine ratiocinatrix_-machine that thinks

versus

_nulla nunc celebrior clamorosiorque secta quam Cartesinorum_

- Mathematics becomes more popular and now we slowly progress towards machines that can do math themselves

## **Alan Turing**
- The turing machine lets Turing think about steps to solve a problem
- when writing he refers to a human that computes as a "computer"
- turing machine works with logic(boolean) and variables


## Shannon
- communication
- figures our relaying info


Combine information theory with Turing's 'universal computer' and you have a way for a machine computer to simulate any of the work a human computer could do.

-   Parallel kinds of 'computing' devices - the analogue simulators
-   Kelvin's tide calculator for different points around the world
-   Kelvin proposes in 1876 a way of linking several similar devices together physically to simulate differential equations
-   the mechanisms to achieve this not developed until the 1920s.... and Vannevar Bush
'programming' these machines:

-   literally bashing them into different shapes with hammers and wrenches.
-   useful for scientific analysis

## George Stibitz-1937
- builds mechanical calculater
- works at Bell labs
- Does a demo where he connects to a calculater through a telephone line in 1940


## Konrad Zuse
- builds calculaters
- gets zero buisness success
- hired by military
- makes a calculator to speed missle production
- builds z3-can store 64 binary digits
- Zuse flees with z4 when Russians invade German but gets captured


## Howard Aitken

-   prof at Harvard. Had designed his own electro-mechanical calculator to help with his thesis work; proposes the machine to the military in 1937; military says nah, though its own reviewing engineer wanted it; engineer introduces Aitken to IBM & Thomas Watson (president)

## Ballistics
-   the industrialization of war over the 19th century - new types of guns (ie, field guns - cannons etc), new types of firepower
-   Reverend Francis Bashforth, 1864-1880 - experiments related to air drag and velocity - produces the first firing tables
-   US military, in aftermath of civial war, establishs testing range to train ballistic officers and work out tables for different kinds of guns



## Mauchly & ENIAC

-    Electronic Numerical Integrator and Calculator/Computer
- This demonstration ignored something quite crucial.

	WHO did the programming?

	HOW LONG did it take to set the program up?
