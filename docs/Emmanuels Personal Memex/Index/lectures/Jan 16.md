Archeologist Discovers Ice Age Writings

  

-   The archeologist thinks the messages are related to gestation and early husbandry/early farmers.
    

  

The Medium is the Message

-   Draws attention to the medium being more important than the message
    
-   We extend our minds into new mediums such as new mediums on the internet
    

  

-   “Medium” is something that carries something else
    
-   Media comes in different classes or kinds of things
    
-   Who decides that something is important?[[@Media Effects-Source Note]]
    
-   Whoever makes that decision gains importance/power themselves!
    
-   “Classifications both reflect and direct our thinking. The way we order represents the way we think”
    

  
  

History of Communication

-   Writing systems were physical and were considered special or a mark of power since they were written on limited things like physical stone tablets
    
-   Libraries of ancient texts are very exclusive and were important as it creates power and control
    
-   Ancient languages eventually become english
    
-   By the time of Romans there is a lot more mobility with writing as there's more places/things to write with/on
    

  
  

-   the medium for a message is as important as the message (both for its affordances or what it permits to write, but also for how it extends our abilities to think/see the world in new ways)
    
-   ­how we classify media/messages has implications for power, control, and discipline (reflects and directs our thinking)
    
-   ­writing/counting intimately connected
    
-   ­the infrastructure for writing spills out, has impacts on society
    
-   ­libraries reflect the world back to itself (for why else would extremists attack library readings & book lists?)
    
-   The Internet is a type of library
    

  

Melvil Dewey(1851-1931)

-   Classifies books as either history,stories or
    
-   Recognizes that his libraries suck due to lack of organization
    
-   His classification made the organization based around his worldview
    
-   Most modern libraries use his organization method
    
-   Deweys system used for public library vs congressman used for congress or research libraries
    

  

Internet Limitations

-   Internet was going to have the ability to use hypertext but it was cut
    
-   no natural way for documents/information to be organized;
    
-   people tried to find a 'natural' way to organize information
    

-   these categorizations ended up reifying the way they already believed the world to work
    

-   in a north american context, the two big approaches hit at the same time there is massive public investment and expansion and reform of education (even the blackboard was a new idea once!)
    
-   proximity on shelves also enables a kind of discoverability; 'serendipity' it's sometimes called: but a function of a particular vision of the world, a reproduction of its norms
    
-   invention of the digital computer happens not all that long after these massive reorganizations
    
-   the digitization of knowledge is built by people for whom these categorizations/classifications of the world are normalized
