- Jeff Bezos starts book company in his garage but was rich and had good education plus a massive loan
- Bezos makes software to make trades
- Bezos starts company in Washington state


**Why Books?**

-   large industry ($25 billion in annual sales)
-   large number of publishers (> 50 000 in US)
-   independent book shops at retail; 2 chains < 25% of retail market
-   chains had stores, assets, employees, warehouses => costs
-   small independents had even higher cost per book than chains
-   Bezos, the small entrpreneur?
    -   Gets a loan of $250 000 from **his parents**.
-   launches in 1995
-   has ~ 1$ million in seed funds from local investors as well

**Business model**

-   ­Low prices?
    -   ­nope
-   ­buy your book online, they get it from the local warehouse, repackage it, and then mail it to you (taking advantage of existing gov't paid for infrastructure)

So... where's the exuberance?
