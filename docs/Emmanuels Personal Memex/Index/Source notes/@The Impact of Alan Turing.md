## Summary 
In the paper from the book Engineering Trustworthy Software Systems Johnathan Bowen talks about the life of Alan Turing discussing as a true "genius". Bowen talks about how until Turing wasnt respected by the general world and was only given credit by scientific groups and circles.  Bowen also discusses various cultural works in the arts that have helped bring regocnition to Turing. This book was an important source for me since it talks about the life of Alan Turing which I find to be one person who managed to make a huge difference within his life and leave behind a massive influence on society as a whole.

## Highlights

- Alan Turing (1912–1954) has a rightful claim to the title of “Founder of Com-puter Science” — [Updated on 2023-03-09 12:38:17](https://hyp.is/LSa9Xr6hEe2F6PtK4KC6OQ/books-scholarsportal-info.proxy.library.carleton.ca/en/read?id=/ebooks/ebooks4/springer4/2019-07-01/2/9783030176013) — Group: #hist1900c-w2023
-I highlighted this because I believe that it shows just how influencial turing was and how without him there would be no computers or internet
- Unlike some theorists he was willing to be involved with practical aspects andwas as happy to wield a soldering iron as he was to wrestle with a mathematicalproblem, normally from a unique angle — [Updated on 2023-03-09 12:40:22](https://hyp.is/d_Namr6hEe2dkVcowdsVKw/books-scholarsportal-info.proxy.library.carleton.ca/en/read?id=/ebooks/ebooks4/springer4/2019-07-01/2/9783030176013) — Group: #hist1900c-w2023 
-I think that this is important as it shows that Alan Turing was able to do physical work as well as the mental work like the women from the [[Mar 8]] lecture and yet both went unoticed for a long time in history
- The term ‘genius’ is diﬃcult to deﬁne precisely, but Alan Turing is generallyacknowledged to be one. — [Updated on 2023-03-09 12:42:07](https://hyp.is/tnrQSr6hEe2SwANuh1C1GQ/books-scholarsportal-info.proxy.library.carleton.ca/en/read?id=/ebooks/ebooks4/springer4/2019-07-01/2/9783030176013) — Group: #hist1900c-w2023
-I believe that this shows just how highly regarded Turing is now in our modern society and how much he truly did in order to earn such a title 

- Turing received an OBE (Oﬃcer of the Order of the British Empire) honourfrom the United Kingdom government for his codebreaking work at BletchleyPark in World War II and was made a Fellow of the Royal Society, the UK’sforemost scientiﬁc society, in 1951 — [Updated on 2023-03-09 12:47:52](https://hyp.is/g6Wh5L6iEe2WlLtsYzJB-A/books-scholarsportal-info.proxy.library.carleton.ca/en/read?id=/ebooks/ebooks4/springer4/2019-07-01/2/9783030176013) — Group: #hist1900c-w2023
-I found it Interesting how britan was willing to give him awards as well as acknoledge him until they found out about his sexuality

- Alan Turing can be considered a found-ing father for the ﬁeld of Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI) — [Updated on 2023-03-09 12:56:10](https://hyp.is/rI6FcL6jEe2OR7_O30Ru7w/books-scholarsportal-info.proxy.library.carleton.ca/en/read?id=/ebooks/ebooks4/springer4/2019-07-01/2/9783030176013) — Group: #hist1900c-w2023
-I think that this is even more important now with the massive increase in accessibility for AI use such as chat gpt which was discussed in class 

- Marvin Minsky of MIT (1927–2016, the 1969 A.M. Turing Award winner)was also a leading light in the AI community and was inﬂuenced by Turing[89]. He discovered a four-symbol seven-state universal Turing machine in 1962 — [Updated on 2023-03-09 12:56:59](https://hyp.is/yi-RWr6jEe2dnEu3fjbpKw/books-scholarsportal-info.proxy.library.carleton.ca/en/read?id=/ebooks/ebooks4/springer4/2019-07-01/2/9783030176013) — Group: #hist1900c-w2023
-This heps showcase Alan Turings legacy and how it continues to impact the world similar to Alexander Bell in the [[Feb 27]] lecture. 

- Turing was a mathematician and philosopher at a time when computer sci-ence did not exist as a separate discipline [27]. As well as being foundational fora new discipline, Turing has also been highly inﬂuential in mathematics and phi-losophy. Perhaps a leading example is the provocative 1989 book The Emperor’sNew Mind by the Oxford mathematician and philosopher of science Roger Pen-rose born 1931) [130]. The ﬁrst two chapters on ‘Can a computer have a mind?’and ‘Algorithms and Turing machines’ are largely based around Turing’s 1936and 1950 papers [154,157]. — [Updated on 2023-03-09 13:05:50](https://hyp.is/BidMar6lEe2OeD-3rwNmZA/books-scholarsportal-info.proxy.library.carleton.ca/en/read?id=/ebooks/ebooks4/springer4/2019-07-01/2/9783030176013) — Group: #hist1900c-w2023
-Its interesting to see the pure scale of Turings life and how it changed philosophy with the [[Turing Test]] 

- The Turing family itself, apart from Alan Turing, has been undistinguished scien-tiﬁcally, although there is a Turing Baronetcy, created in 1638. The 12th Baronet,Sir John Dermot Turing (born 1961), a solicitor, is a nephew of Alan Turing andhas written a 2015 biography about him — [Updated on 2023-03-09 13:24:44](https://hyp.is/qixYEr6nEe2hdbN7SWlD5A/books-scholarsportal-info.proxy.library.carleton.ca/en/read?id=/ebooks/ebooks4/springer4/2019-07-01/2/9783030176013) — Group: #hist1900c-w2023
-Its nice to know that even though Alan Turings life was cut short there are still other members in his family to carry on the legacy
