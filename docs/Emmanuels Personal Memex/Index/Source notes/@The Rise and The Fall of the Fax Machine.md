The Rise and Fall of The Fax Machine is an important article as it discusses what the world was like before the internet as well as showcases what happens when a certain technology becomes too old and slowly declines in popularity.  The author also showcases how the Fax Machine slowly grew as well as the affordability issues with the fax machine. I believe that this book is important as we can see the similarities between the fax machine and many other types of modern technology hence why I believe the people behind each new technology need to make them more viable for the general public to use so that they will stay relevant.


> In an age of instantaneous information and images, it is hard to appreciate themagic that millions in the 1930s experienced upon seeing photographs of distantdisasters appear the next day in their newspapers, or the excitement in the 1980s ofwatching an exact copy of a letter emerge line by line from a machine connectedto the telephone network.

-I agree as I find a lot of older forms of communication are taken for granted.

The basic concept of a facsimile, or fax machine—a machine that electricallytransmits an image—has not changed since 1843. The three main componentswere, and remain, the scanner-transmitter, the transmitting medium, and thereceiver-recorder.


What happened was a global tale involving the diffusion of people, ideas, re-search, manufacturing, and applications from Europe to America to Japan andback. These shifts reflected larger movements of technology, manufacturing,capital, and consumption.


> A history limited to one country would be dreadfullyincomplete.

-concept talked about in class

> It is difficult to overstate the importance of economics for technology. Thebest technology is worthless if it is too costly to be used. For most of fax’s history,competing services and technologies cost much less and performed better.

-This is something that is true and that im guessing held the internets potential back for some time

Fax engineers and entrepreneurs cannot be accused of business naiveté. Manywere successful telegraph, telephone, and computer engineers and managerswho recognized that commercial success depended on economic as well as tech-nical feasibility

Unfortunately, while competition accelerated the rate of innovation andoffered consumers choices, faxing suffered from over-competition for most of itsexistence


> When too many overly enthusiastic entrepreneurs entered the imper-fect, uncertain fax market, they often took business from existing firms instead ofexpanding demand

-I feel like this was understandable for the time which is why I highlighted this

> The theoretical attractions and advantages of facsimile did not really changeover time. What did change was the practical realization of those advantages asembodied in actual machines and experienced not in isolation but in the contextof evolving competitors, comparative economic calculations, and societal expec-tations about communications as various meanings, standards, markets, techno-logical capabilities, and societal demands changed.


- The gap between inflated expectations and technological and commercial fea-sibility also contributed to faxing’s continuing failures.

- The hope of hitting the Next Big Thing induced governments, organizations,firms, and individuals to invest.

- The changing capabilities and economics of fax technology laid the foun-dations for changing concepts of its applications and users

- The fax machine may not automatically be associated with the study of vi-sual culture, but faxing’s ability to replicate and reproduce images, repeatedly ifneeded, over distance and time made the technology an important actor in cre-ating the modern and postmodern worlds. Telegraphy only transmitted printedletters in a rigid format

- Another form of innovation, driven from below by users, both benefitted fromthe diffusion of faxing and accelerated that diffusion as users created new appli-cations unforeseen and unimagined by manufacturers and vendors.
