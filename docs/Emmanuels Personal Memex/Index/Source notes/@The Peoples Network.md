In this article MacDougall goes in depth on [[Alexander Graham Bell]] and the telephone. He talks about how the telephone wasnt gaining the popularity it was originaly suppossed to but with the help of some other investors the company of Bell was able to gain mainstream attention and appeal to the mass groups of people  making the telephone a piece of technology that was able to innovate on itself. It also discusses Western Union and how they tried to compete with Bell which was also disccussed in the [[Feb 27]] lecture however Western Union wasnt trying to get the telegraph into the averag persons hands which led to Bell's success. I chose this article to be a source as I felt that it was able to convey the importance of what Bell wanted with the telephone while also showcasing the surrounding world with companies such as western union and their impact on the telegraph.


"Alexander Graham Bell’s original goal was not to transmit speech, but tomake it visible. Bell was keenly interested in deafness—his mother, Eliza,and future wife, Mabel, were both deaf—and he considered the educationof the deaf his principal purpose in life."
- I highlighted this as I found it interesting how a goal to make something more accessible can lead to creating something else entirely similar to what Dr.Graham was talking about in the lecture where the internet was suppossed to be something where anybody can edit or comment on any articlesimilar to our memexs but instead ended up becoming more like a digital library.

"The telephone did make speech visible, just not in the way Bell hadimagined. For what is a telephone wire but a visible conduit for humanspeech?"
- I highlighted this because I think it goes to show how the telephone is more than just a way to contact others but is a way to make our speech visible
- To link to Briannas memex in the Cataloguing as a Portal note where they said "The use of the word portal really describes how modern digitalized cataloguing feels. We search up a topic we're looking for an we're immediately greeted by sources related to our search. Clicking on the link instantly transports us to that source of information." I felt that a similar thing happened with the initial telephone in a sense that it became a "portal" for speech and communication. https://briannalegros.github.io/personalmemextest/Cataloguing%20as%20a%20Portal/

"The [[U.S. Postal Service]] was by the late nineteenthcentury a true mass medium, more extensive and accessible than the postalsystem of any other country, and seen by most Americans as a crucial democratic good. The telegraph, by contrast, was the child and agent of privatebusiness."
- Goes back to one of the earlier lectures, the postal services was a form of media that was able to have a social influnce on the people which was eventually replaced by the telegraph and then telephone.

"Debates around the telephone in the 1870s, 1880s, and 1890s oftenresembled earlier debates about the telegraph and the mails, just as they anticipated later discourse surrounding radio, television, and the In-ternet."
- Goes to show that the telegraph really is a predecessor of the internet and that both are able to create the same types of debates.

"only in dire circumstances would ordinary Americans have cause to send or receive a telegram."
- relates to [[@The Rise and The Fall of the Fax Machine]] where it was said that "Thebest technology is worthless if it is too costly to be used." I believe that the telegraph and the telephone were held back by the economy and that this will inevitably repeat with the internet.

"Western Union was the first American company of any kind to forge anational monopoly out of what had previously been a competitive industry.After absorbing the United States Telegraph Company and the AmericanTelegraph Company in 1866, Western Union controlled perhaps 90 percentof the telegraph market in the United States."
- This was talked about in the lectures but while western union controlled the telegraph it gives Bell the ability to control telephones

"What Hubbard wanted from Bell was not a telephone. What Hubbard wanted, like everyone else in the industry, was a quadruplex or multiplex telegraph, a device that could transmit four or more messages simultane-ously over a single wire. Bell’s idea was to construct a ‘‘harmonic telegraph’’that could send different messages using different musical notes."
- This conflict of ideas is important as I feel like it highlights issues that proceed to haunt the telephones success

"In the choices he made, we can see his determination to make the telephone a‘‘telegraph for the people,’’ an alternative to Western Union and the accu-mulation of wealth and corporate power it had come to represent."
- I believe that the social idea of a telegraph for the people is an important one as it realtes to the concept of creating a garden via the internet from [[Caufield]] and being able to give everyone a voice/ chance to voice their opinion versus what Western Union wanted.

"His earliest promotional material stressed what he saw as the telephone’s chief advantages over the telegraph:it was simple enough to be used by anyone; it required no knowledge ofMorse code; and it admitted no third parties, in the form of telegraph clerksor messengers, into private communications."
- This accesiblilty is something that I believe is important. Trying to take an already existing concept and making it more usable is important in my opinion. I also find it interesting that there was so much inovation in this period in comparrison to [[@Kumar From Clay Tablets to Web-Source Note]] where the libraries didnt recieve to much conceptual inovation but rather just inovated on how they were presented.

"While Hubbard had hoped to make the telephone a telegraph for the people, the Forbes group preferred to concentrate on the wealthiest seg-ment of the market. The telephone, as Forbes and his colleagues saw it, did not belong to the people. It was not meant to be an answer to monopolyor a new mass medium."
- This is an unfortunate thing that happens to a lot of inventions and makes me wonder if anything of a similar sort ends up happening to the internet

"They were men of means, who could afford topay over a hundred dollars per year for service at a time when that repre-sented more than a quarter of the average worker’s annual wage."
- Where are women in this? Curious to see if they had any say in the telegraph or telephone.

"More dramatic proof of the changes at Bell Telephone came in Novem-ber 1879, when Forbes signed a contract with Western Union, ending competition and the patent battle between the two firms."
- This was discussed in class during [[Feb 27]]  but this in a way helped the telephone so I felt it was important to highlight

"These technological systems seemed to offer arguments fo rthe ideal of system itself—for the standardization of procedures, the consol-idation of ownership, and the centralization of control. ‘‘A railway, like a vast machine, the wheels of which are all connected with each other . . .requires a certain harmony, and cannot be worked by a number of inde-pendent agents,’’ declared one 1850 treatise on the economy of railways.‘‘The organization of a railway requires unity of direction and harmony of movement, which can only be attained by the combination of the entirecarrying business with the general administration of the road.’’70 Vail wouldecho this language all his life."
- I highlighted this as I find the railroad analogy to be a smart one. Reminds me of the garden analogy in [[Caufield]] and how that can be used to convey an idea.

"If Forbes and Hubbard had any-thing in common, it was that both men saw the telephone as a means tosome end. For Vail, the telephone network was an end in itself. What inter-ested him most was neither profit nor the people, but rather the organiza-tion and expansion of the system."
- This intrigues me as the expansion of the telephone from my perspective would theretically still make the telephone the mean to an end.

"The operating companies valued their independence from American Bell and resisted attempts by the parent firm to control or direct their operations."
- I beleive that this is important and that every company should to some degree try to value their independance as it creates competition in that market

"The name of the new company suggested one more goal. Vail ultimatelyhoped to unify all wire communications in America—both telephone andtelegraph—under one company’s control."
- I feel like this is inheritly an actually good thing as it could lead to the telephone and telgraph becoming bigger and reach all groups of people

"The telephone did not become an instrument of the people. By 1893,there were only 266,000 telephones in the entire United States, or approxi-mately one telephone for every 250 people."
- This result was unfortunate and I feel like this contributed to less disscussion created around social/political issues back it the 1800s as there was less communication between people who lived farther away from each other which probably slowed progress down.

"One thing that Forbes and Hubbard both seemed to understand wasthat ideas about the telephone were inescapably political. They involvedarguments about monopoly and competition, about national and localcommerce, and about the proper scale of business and social life."
- A lot of things and inovations are inheretly going to have some degree of politicalness involved. For example [[@History of Cryptography and Cryptanalysis-Source Note]] shows how cryptology ends up being used by governments and military to keep political secrets.
