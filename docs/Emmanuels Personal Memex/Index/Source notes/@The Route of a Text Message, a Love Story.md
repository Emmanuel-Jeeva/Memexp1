## Summary
The article "The Route of a Text Message, a Love Story" tells the story of how a text message travels from the sender to the recipient and shows concepts used throughout the course. Weingart talks about the process of sending a text. Along the way, Weingart reflects on how technology has transformed our ability to communicate, and how the simple act of sending a text message can have profound emotional significance. Ultimately, the article is a celebration of the ways in which technology can bring us closer together, even as it connects us across great distances. I believe this relates back to my memex's theme of people as it showcases how the internet has impacted all people in small ways as well as lardge ones.




## Highlights
-These days, you might not even realize an SMS can only be 160 characters. Androids and iPhones, clever as they are, weave long messages together behind the scenes so when we receive them, we can’t tell they were split apart for delivery.
- I believe that this is a cocept that relates back to [[@Kumar From Clay Tablets to Web-Source Note]] as it showcases how a piece of technology or media may keep its core fundementals while subtly evolving without the general audience realising
-It’s a bit like encryption, or maybe steganography: anyone can see the text, but only I can decode the hidden data.
- Shows how our own language takes pieces of [[Cryptology and Cryptography + the Internet]] and allows us to communicate secrets.
-The really fascinating bit here is that it reaches the base transceiver station at all, given everything else going on. Not only is my wife texting me “I love you” in the 1000ish mhz band of the electromagnetic spectrum; tens of thousands of other people are likely talking on the phone or texting within the 30 mile radius around my house, beyond which cell signals disintegrate. On top of that, a slew of radio and TV signals are jostling for attention in our immediate airspace, alongside visible light bouncing this way and that, to name a few of the many electromagnetic waves that seem like they ought to be getting in the way.
- I felt like this higlights in a way a culmination of a lot of the different types of technology mentioned in this course such as the Telephone,radio and lastly the internet 
-Red, green, and blue combine to form white light in a single pixel. Fiddle with the luminosity of each channel, and you get every color in the rainbow. And since 4 x 3 = 12, that’s 12 million tiny sources of light sitting innocently dormant behind my black mirror, waiting for me to press the power button to read my wife’s text.
- I highlighted this because it makes me realise how complex even the simplest of technology we use is.
-So here I am, in the office late one Sunday night. “I love you,” my wife texted from the bedroom downstairs, before the message traversed 40 or so feet to my phone in a handful of seconds. I realize what it means: it’s time to wish her goodnight, and perhaps wrap up this essay. I tap away the last few words, now slightly more cognizant of the complex layering of miles, signals, years of history, and human sweat it took to keep my wife from having to shout upstairs that it’s about damn time I get some rest.
- I highlighted this as it shows how all the history that we have looked at in class has culminated into the internet and the ability to communicate with anyone at anytime
