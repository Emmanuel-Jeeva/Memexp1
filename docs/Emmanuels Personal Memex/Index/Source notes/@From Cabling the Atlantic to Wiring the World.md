The article “From Cabling the Atlantic to Wiring the World: A Review Essay on the 150th Anniversary of the Atlantic Telegraph Cable of 1866.”  is a critical review of existing scholarship while simultaneously suggesting new per-spectives for research. The article looks at the at the globalization of politics, markets, and media means in connection to communication, and  
whether the cables really started something radically new. It also looks at the first Attlantic cable as well as some thoeries on what groups of peole such as women were doing at the time. I believe that this source is important since it talks about both the telegraph as well as what people such as women were allowed to do at the time. I believe it gives a glimpse at an important part of the history of the telegraph and can help enlighten a persons perspective

## Page Notes
## Highlights
- On a perrsonal level,the cable's influence changed people's perceptions of time, distance, and therelationships between nations and continents. — [Updated on 2023-03-04 17:30:58](https://hyp.is/PGArSLrcEe2creMfT8Hxxw/www-jstor-org.proxy.library.carleton.ca/stable/pdf/44017442.pdf?refreqid=excelsior%3A01c7a32daf3bf0d9082c7b08a402d079&ab_segments=&origin=&initiator=&acceptTC=1) — Group: #hist1900c-w2023

	-Shows just how influence the atlantic cable was. It relates back to [[@The Peoples Network]] as it shows how Alexander Grahams Bells original vision of simply just offering of making speech more visible with the telephone was never going to work out as the telegraph on its own was revolutionary

- Others claim that the tech-nology's speed and apparent instantaneity in addition to the worldwidereach of telegraph networks provided the basis for processes of global inte-gration and interdependence. — [Updated on 2023-03-04 17:32:18](https://hyp.is/a_HCaLrcEe2Qpe9D4v3dWQ/www-jstor-org.proxy.library.carleton.ca/stable/pdf/44017442.pdf?refreqid=excelsior%3A01c7a32daf3bf0d9082c7b08a402d079&ab_segments=&origin=&initiator=&acceptTC=1) — Group: #hist1900c-w2023
	- I highlighted this because it shows how the telegraph was infleuncial around the world.

- Still, the equation telegraphy = globalization should make scholarsuneasy and cautious of a possible technological determinism retracing itssteps back into the middle of scholarly debates on globalization. More at-tention needs to be paid as to whose globalization we are talking about,what the globalization of politics, markets, and media means in its con-nection to communication, and whether the cables- when read against thehistory of global postal services, for instance- really kicked off somethingradically new. — [Updated on 2023-03-04 17:35:21](https://hyp.is/2Rw-IrrcEe2csmtT2LPZlA/www-jstor-org.proxy.library.carleton.ca/stable/pdf/44017442.pdf?refreqid=excelsior%3A01c7a32daf3bf0d9082c7b08a402d079&ab_segments=&origin=&initiator=&acceptTC=1) — Group: #hist1900c-w2023
	- connects back to [[@The Peoples Network]] where its discussed about how the telphone and certain ideas around it were politicol. There was also talk about the social impact which I think both had massive impacts on how humanity socialised during its time.

- But what about the network's content? Tracing the individual tele-graph correspondence between Britain's colonial office in London andCeylon's governor, Paul Fletcher showed that in the nineteenth century,mail and telegrams went hand in hand with everyday colonial communi-cation. — [Updated on 2023-03-04 18:02:15](https://hyp.is/myCdTrrgEe2RKtsQukJNcw/www-jstor-org.proxy.library.carleton.ca/stable/pdf/44017442.pdf?refreqid=excelsior%3A01c7a32daf3bf0d9082c7b08a402d079&ab_segments=&origin=&initiator=&acceptTC=1) — Group: #hist1900c-w2023
	- relates to [[@Telecommunications and Colonial Rivalry]] where the colonisers take advantage of land to build the lines to communicate easly.

- They did so irrespective of bor-ders defined by race, class, gender, or nation. Non-users interacted withthe information sent through telegraphs, for exa — [Updated on 2023-03-04 18:14:56](https://hyp.is/YJT70rriEe2QxON7bLy1aA/www-jstor-org.proxy.library.carleton.ca/stable/pdf/44017442.pdf?refreqid=excelsior%3A01c7a32daf3bf0d9082c7b08a402d079&ab_segments=&origin=&initiator=&acceptTC=1) — Group: #hist1900c-w2023
	- I highlighted this since it goes back to lectures and finds out what marginalised groups of people and [[women and their impact]] are able to do.
