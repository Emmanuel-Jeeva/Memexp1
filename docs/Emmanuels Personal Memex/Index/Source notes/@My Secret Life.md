## Summary
The article "My Secret Life as an 11-Year-Old BBS Sysop" by Benji Edwards is a personal account of his experience as a young boy running a Bulletin Board System (BBS) in the 1990s. Benji starts with how he ended up working on BBSes and eventually came to his own decision to run his own. Benji explains how a BBS is set up which I believe is important as it gives us context to a period of history of the early internet.  Benji explains how helps show the challenges that he faces while making the BBS. Benji also reflects on the sense of community he felt as a BBS operator and the valuable lessons he learned about responsibility and leadership. I believe this article helps show Benji's growth over the course of time and helps show his experience and in the process makes Benji an important figure in my memex.

## Highlights
-While commercial online services like [CompuServe](https://www.vintagecomputing.com/index.php/archives/1059/retro-scan-of-the-week-my-compuserve-password) and [Prodigy](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/07/where-online-services-go-when-they-die/374099/) existed then, many hobbyists ran their own miniature online services called bulletin board systems, or [BBSes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulletin_board_system) for short.
- I highlighted this as I believe it relates back to the [[Mar 20]] lecture where we talked about what a [[BBS]] is 

-Whereas the Internet is a huge connected web of systems with billions of users, most BBSes were small hobbyist fiefdoms with a single phone line, and only one person could call in and use it at a time. Although BBS-to-BBS message networks were common, each system still felt like its own island culture with a tin-pot dictator (the system operator—or "sysop" for short) who lorded over anyone who visited.
- I believe this helps show how niche and small the internet was before the events of the [[Mar 29]] lecture where google starts pumping ads and websites become about selling products

-I explored several BBS software options. At my dad's or Doug's suggestion, I tried Procomm Plus's built-in host mode, which was very bare-bones and unappealing. I also used a separate program called "Minihost," which was a minimal BBS package.
- I highlighted this as I think it helps give context to how BBS packages worked/ how there was options

-The last day of the original Cave BBS was February 9, 1998. I was in 11th grade, about to turn 17 years old. I remember waking up one morning, checking the BBS, and noticing that a memory leak (which was common with BBS door games) had crashed the BBS again. Instead of resetting it, I decided to just take it offline. I held no ceremony and shed no tears; it just felt like time to hang up the ol' BBS and move on.
- This in my opionion is a significant moment as it shows how many others BBS might have been taken offline due to technical errors eventually killing this aspect of the internet permantly
- I believe that this also relates to Eric Desrosiers memex https://glng3r.github.io/memex/Faxed%20Coopersmith/%40coopersmithFaxedRiseFall2015%20source/  where he talks about "Coopersmith does this in order to show that even if you have a useful technology, if it does not make sense economically than it is a failed invention." and this concept of having a technology that fails but even though it failed it helps create a new technology.
