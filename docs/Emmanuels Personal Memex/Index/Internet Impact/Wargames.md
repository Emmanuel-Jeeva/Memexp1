**What Wargames Is**


"On this day, June 3rd, 1983, War Games starring Matthew Broderick hit big screens across the United States. The movie had all the staples of a 1980s Cold War techno-thrillerâ€”a super powerful, blunt, and ruthless military-industrial complex, cutting-edge tech way beyond reality for the time, computers and more computers, and of course, 'super kids' that play the film's protagonists and the main problem solvers. The movie actually spoke to an ever more glaring reality of the time, that a major nuclear exchange with the Soviet Union would end in a world-shattering loss of life. The film's most memorable line, voiced by a computer, underscored just how depraved the stakes were: "The only winning move is not to play.""

## Highlights

-the dawn of the U.S. government taking cybersecurity seriously across its entire enterprise, and especially its sprawling strategic command and control infrastructure, was largely born out of the movie War Games.
- While most people will think of this as crazy i think it shows how important film can be on influencing our culture and how film is a lot like the media in the [[@Media Effects-Source Note]]
