**What is a BBS?**
"A bulletin board system (BBS) is a computer or an application dedicated to the sharing or exchange of messages or other files on a network. Originally an electronic version of the type of bulletin board found on the wall in many kitchens and work places, the BBS was used to post simple messages between users."

## Highlights

-Most BBSes are devoted to a particular subject, although some are more general in nature. Among special interests represented on BBSes are dentistry, law, guns, multi-player games, Druidic practices, and information for the disabled.
- Shows how theres a community for everything which is gone over in more detail in [[@The Birth of the Modem World]]
-The first BBS, called the Computerized Bulletin Board System (CBBS), was created in 1978 by Ward Christensen and Randy Suess. Although ARPANET was in operation at that time, it was restricted to institutions funded by the U.S. Department of Defense.
- I consider this information to be important as documenting the connections between the BBS and ARPANET is important due to both having massive impacts on the internet
