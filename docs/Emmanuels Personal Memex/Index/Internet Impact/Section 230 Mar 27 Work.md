The first mistake i spotted was The CDA was passed into law on February 15th, 2006 as it should be 1996.

The second thing I noticed was "it is not clear what exactly constitutes “obscene” or “sexually explicit material.”" is something that is still being argued about to this day.

There were mistakes pointed out by others about how section 230 did not stop sexually explicit content from ending up in the hands of minors and the relationship to the modern ay banning of tiktok in the United States.

I believe this excercise was beneficial as it helped educate the class on section 230 as well as helped us build connections with each others work using hypothesis. The connection to tiktok allows us to see history repeat itself in a modern world.
