## Journey so Far

My memex is about people, their ideas and how these ideas contribute to our society. People such as Alexander Graham Bell,Alan Turing and Mike Caufield. I believe that by focussing on the idividuals who helped shape these new technologies we can start to take in their perspectives and use those perspectives to look at the technologies/ideas they made with a new "lens" and potentially learn new things and form new opinions about their technology or ideas.
