Diving deepr into cryptogorophy after reading the [[@History of Cryptography and Cryptanalysis-Source Note]] wanted to relate it back to the internet as well as learn more about its history

-The internet is a medium that transfers information with its reach and ease of availibility[[Jan 16]]
-Cryptology scrambles the information in a manner that an unintended recipient cannot easily extract the information
-cryptography systems can also be categorized on the basis of encryption of plain text i.e., block cipher encrypt the input block by block while stream cipher processes the input one element at a time
-crypt comes from a Greek word that means "hidden" or "secret." _Cryptography_ literally means "secret writing." _Cryptology,_ meanwhile, means something like "knowledge of secrecy"
-In the 1960s IBM made an encryption method known as "Lucifer"
-There are two many types of crytopgraphy used for the internet
	-**Symmetric cryptography.**-in this case, how many letters forward or backwards in the alphabet you need to move to transform plaintext to ciphertext or vice versa. That's what makes it symmetrical. But the key needs to stay a secret between the two people which is why this is sometimes also called _secret key cryptography_. Symetric crytogroophy is good for keeping information confidential.
	-**Asymmetric cryptography** -In asymmetric cryptography, each participant has _two_ keys. One is public and is sent to anyone the party wishes to communicate with. That's the key used to encrypt messages. But the other key is private, shared with nobody, and it's necessary to decrypt those messages.The computations needed for asymmetric cryptography are much more complex and resource intensive that those behind symmetric infrastructure.
-Cryptography is now more important than ever allowing people to keep information safe
- I chose these two articles because I thought that they would help further learning about cryptology and cryptography which I believe may be more useful once we get to the history of the internet
