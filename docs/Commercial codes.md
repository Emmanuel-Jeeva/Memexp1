*I was interested in what commercial codes were from the [[@History of Cryptography and Cryptanalysis-Source Note]] and decided to learn more here*

In this article the introduction of commercial codes is explained into further detail.
-Commercial codes were able to reduce price and increase security
-Some codes took advantage of loopholes in the regulations or were often against the regulations
-typical telegraph codes had a much larger vocabulary. The vocabulary included not only words but also phrases, occasionally made of many words
-many commercial codes proposed some kind of manipulation of encoded message in order to secure privacy
-I believed that it was important to learn about commercial codes since they are an aspect of security that Im assuming could be useful later in the course when we start talking more about the internet itself

**todo**
	put this into the todo folder as I believe this may be useful once we get on to the internet itself
