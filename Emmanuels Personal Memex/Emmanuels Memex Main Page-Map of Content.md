## Journey so Far

My memex is about people, their ideas and how these ideas contribute to our society. People such as Alexander Graham Bell,Alan Turing, Pam Hardt and Mike Caufield. I believe that by focussing on the idividuals who helped shape these new technologies we can start to take in their perspectives and use those perspectives to look at the technologies/ideas they made with a new "lens" and potentially learn new things and form new opinions about their technology or ideas. With my third and final memex I have expanded this view to not just include individuals but also groups of people such as the group that mde BBS's, group that made ARPANET and the people behind Bell Labs. These groups are usually filled with groups of people who all have to come together in order to work on a single idea and each group has contributed to the internet equally.

*While there is no forced reading order for my memex I would reccomend starting with the General Memex material to get familiarlised with what you will see and then go to the source notes choosing to branch out to linked notes as you wish and afterwards reading all the other notes within their appropriate sections*
