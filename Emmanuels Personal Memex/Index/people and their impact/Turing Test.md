The Turing Test is a method of inquiry in artificial intelligence (AI) for determining whether or not a computer is capable of thinking like a human being. The test is named after Alan Turing, the founder of the Turing Test and an English computer scientist, cryptanalyst, mathematician and theoretical biologist. — [Updated on 2023-03-09 17:30:05](https://hyp.is/8PeS7r7JEe20g_fpR5hzFw/www.techtarget.com/searchenterpriseai/definition/Turing-test) — Group: #hist1900c-w2023 


The turing test is a test that is supposed to help figure out if a computer or ai is conscious however philosophers still find deciding whether our modern ai are conscious to be subjective.

A link to Eric Desrosiers Memex in his Organizing information note he writes "she compresses the information into indexes with highlighting. This is very similar to the way we are organizing information by making a source note with a bunch of atomic notes building off of our information."-when reading this I thought of the Turing test and how AI may still have strugles with condensing information in a "human way" as certain Ai such as Chat Gpt currently have a very formulaic approach when it comes to writing https://glng3r.github.io/memex/
