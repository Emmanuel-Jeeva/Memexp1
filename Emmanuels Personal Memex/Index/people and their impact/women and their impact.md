The article "When Computers Were Women" By Jennifer Light discusses the "human computers" which were all women from the 1930s to the 1960s. The article also discusses how women helped program the first computers.

Light goes into depth in material similar to that which was seen in the lectures where early stages of computing were seen as a womens job until post ww2 were the field slowly got dominated by men.

- 3 Wartime Opportunities forWomen proclaimed, "It's a Woman's World!"4 Such accounts hailedunprecedented employment opportunities as men were recruited for combat positions.
	- It is unfortunate that most of these jobs only lasted for the war and that post ww2 men reclaimed most work back
- men doing more "important" technical and classifiedwork remained in noncombatant positions. Thus, the meaning of "wartimelabor shortage" was circumscribed even as it came into being. While collegeeducated engineers considered the task of computing too tedious for themselves, it was not too tedious for the college-educated women who made upthe majority of computers
	- Yet computers were eventually deemed important and therfore became a "men's" job anyway
- ENIAC was the offspring of a wartime alliance between a university(the University of Pennsylvania, specifically the Moore School of ElectricalEngineering) and the U.S. armed forces,
	- I think this adds context to the [[Mar 6]] lecture as it shows that Eniac was quite a big deal
