-Enables the industrialisation of individual patterns

-built on labour of women in lots of ways

-women did a lot but not shown

  

-old cpus were woven by teams

-one used for apollo was woven by women

  
  

**Why we need archeology**

-the internet is physical in a way and needs archaeology to learn about it

  

-”archeology is the science of human duration”-roots used for submarines in past become telephone lines

  

**The Point**

Theory is important

  

History of the net has many aspects. How can we bring order to this?

  

This is what 'theory' is for. Theory is a framework for understanding the world & directing your attention.

  

Theory tells you which bits are important. Theory helps frame your questions.

  

But there are many different theories to order our observations.

  
  
  
  

-the workers who built the past things such as the internet may not have been given credit

  

Space/Economy

-Reconfiguring space and time using technology makes things faster

-telegraph was the first internet and sped things up

  
  
  

Complicated vs Complex

-complex systems are things like queensway highway-if one person slows down their car it ruins everyone else's car and causes a traffic jam in wave pattern

-complicated systems are things such as space shuttles which go instantly

  

-different levels of emergence

-different network shapes enable emergence

-feedback is a big part of this

  

Assemblage Theory

Agencement things come together

-   Meaning depends on context
    

-   Both internal, within
    
-   External in time
    
-   External in space
    
-   Nothing is meaningful on its own-like a potter making a pot having to put everything together
    

Perspectivism

-   the way we record information matters
    
-   we try to mirror 'natural breakages', but there are many ways to make the decisions
    
-   these categories emerge from our engagement with the material
    

  
  

Summary

-there's a network present whenever theres a relationship between two or more entities, we need to find out what relationship flows between the two

-complex and complicated phenomena are different

-   a network is present whenever there is a relationship between two entities along which information flows. (argh! we'll need a definition of information!)
    
-   networks form a substrate for social life, and humans aren't the only things that can have a social life
    
-   networks leave physical traces
    
-   more complex phenomena can emerge from interactions in certain network shapes
    
-   networks also provide a formal mechanism through which computation can happen - computation is inherent in the shape of the network
    
-   the components of a networked history are not just the technical objects, but also the assemblage
    
-   material agencies extend cognition into our things
    
-   meaning is relational
