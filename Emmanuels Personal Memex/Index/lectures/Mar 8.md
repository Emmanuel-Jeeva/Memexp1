##  COLOSSUS

![[Pasted image 20230308132434.png]]

-   developed during WWII
-   emerges from the Bombe
-   never fully declassified until well after the war
-   supervening necessity: German wolfpack


_"It was luck the security people didn't know about Turing being gay early on, because if they had known, he might not have obtained his clearnace and we might have lost the war"_

-   a member of Turing's team.


##  Bombe to Colossus



-   Turing's teacher, Max Newman, leads design of Colossus
-   Colossus could suggest best match for a pattern within a text
-   second colossus could figure out which pattern was best to try
-   integrating valves the key

## Post War Developments Doldrums

-   multiple teams are exploring these machines that sit on the calculator/computer barrier
-   von Neumann writes the 'First Draft of a Report on The EDVAC' 1945
-   but for the most part, the urgency is gone; everyone losing steam, in terms of computing design
-   last technical hurdle to solve is the problem of memory (many solutions mooted, workable)

## From One Supervening Necessity to Another

-   Project Whirlwind
    -   starts off as a kind of analogue computer meant to simulate flight on multiple kinds of airplanes being developed during the war
-   most expensive of the various computing projects; navy loses interest
-   airforce takes over: the only machine that could plot intercept courses for strategic long range bombers
-   solves the problem of magnetic memory

## Meanwhile in Britain

-   Manchester Baby
-   built to test another solution to the problem of memory
-   runs a stored program from memory in 1948 - another 'first computer!' moment


## Allies no longer sharing information

-   act of congress in 1946 closes off data sharing with allies over nuclear work
-   Britain sets out to build its own expertise
-   Decides that all such experiments ought to be centralised at the National Physical Laboratory
-   The 'official' British Computer will be built at NPL, and they turn to Turing to make it, the 'Automatic Computing Engine'

## The Death of Alan Turing

-   Turing moves to Manchester to work on computing 1948
-   His house is burgled; he calls the police. In the course of their investigation, Turing is forced to admit he is homosexual. 1952
-   He was found guilty of gross indecency; imprisonment or probation with chemical castration
-   loses security clearances. Chooses castration.
-   commits suicide 1954
-   pardoned in 2012

## The Period of the Digital Incunabula is Over

-   In the UK, commerical versions of the Manchester 'Baby' are being sold by the Ferranti corporation as general purpose business computers by 1951
-   By 1952, IAS machine comes online
-   The digital age begins
-   "There will never be enough problems, enough work for more than one or two of these computers... stop this foolishness with Eckert and Mauchly" - I wonder if Aitken ate those words


## IBM finally gets in on the act

-   Incidentally, on some accounts, this is when the digital humanities are born
- Did not believe in a market for computers

## Programming still an issue

-   every computer has its own wiring, circuits, designs, idiosyncracies
-   people like Grace Hopper are building compilers and higher level languages to ease programming and provide some interoperability
-   mostly male programmers liked the secrecy of the way things were

## Upshot

-   every machine is unique
-   every machine is ever larger, more expensive
-   living on the gov't dime: both the funder, and buyer for these devices, largely.
-   Eventually, something's gotta give: is it an effective use of money to build machines like this that could often stand (comparatively) idle?

## Is it time for the internet yet?

Competences

-   existence of digital computers
-   existence of telecommunication networks
-   existence of information theory
-   ideas around flow control, logic, algorithms
-   demonstration of control of a calculator over a phone line in 1940


## The Grand Myth of the Internet

"A system designed to prevent breakdown in the event of a nuclear war"

The truth is a bit more nuanced. And we'll take that up on Monday.
