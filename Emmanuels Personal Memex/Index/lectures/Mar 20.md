## 1984
- Apple drops Machintosh


## The plot so far:

-   the emergence of personal computers
-   the emergence of BBS and other online services that are _not_ the internet
-   Remember, the other kind of 'computer' most people would be familiar with would be the Atari video game console (and similar)
    -   playing games -> desire to connect -> WarGames -> regulatory climate
    -   playing games -> technological innovation

-   these early communities give people a sense of how to _be_ , via a computer
-   because a lot of the early games were about recreating a sense of an actual place, my contention: these actually _were_ places, for all intents and purposes.
-   they were someplace you _went._ Your body might be here, but your mind & social world were elsewhere.



Where the people go, capitalism is sure to follow. It just depends on having the right metaphor.
