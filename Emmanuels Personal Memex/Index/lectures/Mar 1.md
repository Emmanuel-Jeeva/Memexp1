## Information Theory

![[Pasted image 20230301132533.png]]


By the end of the 19th century, 'networks' were not a novel idea

**Bell**
"In a similar manner, it is conceivable that cables of telephone wires could be laid underground, or suspended overhaed, communicating by branch wires with private dweelings, country houses, shops, manufactories... uniting them through the main cable with a central office where the wires could be connected as desired, establishing direct communication between any two places... I believe, in the future, wires will unite the head offices of the Telephone Company in different cities, and a man ...may communicate by word of mouth with another in a distant place."

-   First Bell company founded 1875
-   First telephone exchange operated by Western Union's telephone subsidery
-   First woman central office operator: 1878, Emma Nutt
-   Idea of assigning unique numbers to subscribers suggested in 1879

The Strowger automatic exchange - 1892

-   First two decades of telephony - very slow uptake (remember, I'm talking US most of the time unless I say otherwise. Good research question for you: what's the situation in Canad?)
-   subject to interference from other electrical sources - trolleys, telegraph wires, thunderstorms

'National Bell' becomes 'American Bell'

Upshot:

-   Hubbard & Bell are out
-   Theodore Vail remains - relates to [[@The Peoples Network]] were smaller companies wanted to remain independant but Vail tries to buy them up
-   The agreement with Western Union still in force

Which breaks the agreement.

-   1884 American Bell estalishes long distance line between NY & Boston.
-   Creates a subsidiary company to do this: American Telephone & Telegraph Company(AT&T)
-   establishes a laboratory to improve long distance telephony
- -   1888 - all the court battles around the original patents are won by Bell
-   Bell is making money hand over fist, even though rest of the economy is in depression
-   Too bad the patents just won were about to expire
- -   Independents appear; Bell fights them with both legitimate & spurious court cases
-   cuts rates ridiculously where there is competion
-   refuses to interconnect to other systems
-   buys up stocks of competitors

Back to main thread:

-   long distance telephony was central to Bell's plan to survive the expiration of its patents
-   seemed also that Bell was directing customers to use telegraph services that it owned/had major stake in
-   antitrust legislation, populist politicians, interstate commerce commission: AT&T in the crosshairs

**Bell labs**
- Devoted to research
- More research Bell does the more profit they can take without needing the government
- Continues their "research whatever you want" during ww2 while contributing to the war

Claude Shannon shows us that electrical circuits *can perform logical operations*

Which opens the door to machines that can read instructions, perform a computation, and change their own rules based on the results of that computation.

That is to say: a digital computer.
In Bell labs he makes information theory
