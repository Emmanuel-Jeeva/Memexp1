## Hypertext and The Web

But first, some dates to hang the narrative on

![](https://images.computerhistory.org/internethistory/1983_topo.gif)

-   1983 - ARPANET switches over to TC/ICP; MILNET split off
-   1983 Domain Names system devised
-   1984 comes into effect: gov, .mil, .edu, .org, .net, and .com.
-   1986 NSF backbone is built; NSF, like DCA before it, limits use to 'approved' uses. Also decides to use TC/ICP
-   1987 over 10 000 hosts now on 'the internet'
-   1988 commercial email allowed to be transported over NSFNet - commercialization of that infrastructure begins
-   Senator Al Gore becomes interested in networks for research
-   1990 ARPANet shuts down
-   1991 Gore proposes, and sees it through, The High Performance Computing Act. This is the 'information superhighway' financing bill, which amongst other things funds the team that builds the first Webrowser (Mosaic, 1993; evolves into Netscape)
-   1991 web comes into existence; 1993 explodes into popular imagination

First 'viruses' and 'worms' written mostly as experiments

Creeper - designed by Bob Thomas at BBN; it would copy itself onto connected computers. the first worm. 1971. 'I'M THE CREEPER CATCH ME IF YOU CAN'

Reaper - designed by Ray Tomlison, to seek out and eliminate Creeper. 1972

ANIMAL - the first Trojan - 1975, by John Walker

-   ANIMAL was a 20-questions style game, 'what animal am I thinking of?'
-   secret program included in it called PERVADE; when game ran, PERVADE would examine the system for directories available to the user, and then copy ANIMAL to those directories

Once the genie is out of the bottle, lots of virus/worms/trojans emerge

Often the motivation is curiosity - who _wouldn't_ want to create artificial life, amirite?

But not always.

BRAIN BOOT SECTOR VIRUS - first IBM PC virus - 1986

-   would essentially crash the machine during boot up
- would activate if you ran a pirated copy of their software originaly but then the virus was taken and put onto multiple IBM pc's

## The Morris Worm - 1988

-   within 24 hours approximately 1/10th of connected machines (~ 6000) infected

## The story so far

-   the 1980s sees a growing awareness of 'connected' computing
-   turning up in culture (eg WarGames; Terminator)
-   commercialization of the government created infrastructure
-   internetworking of private networks into that infrastructure
-   common carriage of traffic (what is later called net neutrality) a feature
-   Al Gore secures funding for another round of development, meant to expand access and foster more research

Jorge Luis Borges, Garden Of Forking Paths (spanish, 1941; English, 1948)

"This web of time - the strands of which approach one another, bifurcate, intersect or ignore each other through the centureis - embraces every possibility"
- any reading with footnotes or ways to navigate is like an early form of hypertext

In computerized hypertext

-   some act of selection enables you to pass to another level or another related concept
    
-   a formalization and action based on a _relationship_
    
-   the relationship itself has some capacity to _act_

Ted Nelson, Xanadu

-   coins the word 'hypertext'
-   never built


A _pattern language_, per [Maggie Appleton](https://maggieappleton.com/xanadu-patterns) helps us approach questions like:

-   How do we structure information and build relationships between pieces of data that help us see them across contexts, and clarify understanding?
-   How do we build systems that allow people to collaborate on shared documents without losing authorship? How do we credit and compensate authors based on their contributions?
-   How do we bring ideas and data from a variety of sources into conversation with our own, while leaving a clear trail back to the origin?

-   **Maggie Appleton**

Nelson: "HTML is precisely what we were trying to PREVENT— ever-breaking links, links going outward only, quotes you can't follow to their origins, no version management, no rights management."

"What we're now seeing is the ad-hoc, decentralised manifestation of Xanadu in bits and pieces.

People are building Xanadu without knowing what Xanadu is.

Which is the essence of a good pattern language; true patterns evolve naturally within systems, and are found rather than crafted." - Maggie Appleton


## Microcosm

-   1986 BBC produces a new Domesday Book - on laser disc
-   interactive explorations, with links & a pointer; [demo from 1991](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DF9oAwUgmKo)
-   inspiration for Wendy Hall, U Southampton

Intermedia - connected five different applications into a 'scholar's workstation' Nicole Yankelovich, Nancy Garrett, Karen Caitlin; Apple nicks elements of the design

-Sun Microsystems - Link Service, developed by Amy Pearl

-Symbolics - Symbolics Document Examiner by Janet Walker



**Clare Evans:**

"Today, we mostly think of hypertext as being something related to the Web, rather than of the Web as a technically inferior manifestation of hypertext principles"
