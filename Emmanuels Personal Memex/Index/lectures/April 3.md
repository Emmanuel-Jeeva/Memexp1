_...the situation Aaron found himself in highlights the injustice of U.S. computer crime laws, and particularly their punishment regimes. Aaron's act was undoubtedly political activism, and taking such an act in the physical world would, at most, have a meant he faced light penalties akin to trespassing as part of a political protest. Because he used a computer, he instead faced long-term incarceration_.

## enshittification

[Cory Doctorow](https://www.wired.com/story/tiktok-platforms-cory-doctorow/)

_Here is how platforms die: First, they are good to their users; then they abuse their users to make things better for their business customers; finally, they abuse those business customers to claw back all the value for themselves. Then, they die._

Enshittification was understood from the beginning - Page & Brin in 1998:

"Advertising funded search engines will be inherently biased towards the advertisers and away from the needs of consumers"
