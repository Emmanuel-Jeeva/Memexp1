## Summary and Take Aways
In the article Dennis Mcquall tries to analyse the effect the media has over people and how it can potentially be used to influence society. Since this was written in 1977 the internet was not really a relevent way for the media to spread news so I thought it would be interesting to see how the media could influence people pre internet

-One point made is about our connection to our favorite media personalities and how often times we share some values with them which can lead to us sharing all of our values over time

-overtime while the media may choose to share certain messages to use we ultimatly decide what we take in and how we respond to it

-sometimes the process of learning information from the media is unconscious and unintentional


After reading the article I believe that while the media definetly has influence over our thought it still depends on every person to judge and asses the things they read or hear about and come to their own cnclusions based upon their own beliefs.


## Page Notes
## Highlights
- Questions about the effects of the mass media cannot be answered in broad generalities. — [Updated on 2023-02-02 17:44:31](https://hyp.is/KFCWSqNLEe2FGl8iGbs6Xw/docdrop.org/ocr/download/The_influence_and_effects_of_mass_media-0a1gk_ocr.pdf) — Group: #Public
	- I decided to highlight this since I believe since I since I think it ties back nicely to Jan 16 lecture where we discussed the effects of the media. 
- The questions most insistently asked of social research on mass communication, and perhaps least clearly answered, have to do with the effects and social influence of the different mass media.
	- I highlighted this as I though it was important to understand that getting answers on this topic were probabl not going to be the easiest thing to do and that I may not get a clear simple answer
- we mainly consider the process of learn- ing through the media, a process which is often incidental, unplanned and unconscious for the receiver and almost always unintentional on the part of the sender. Hence the concept of ‘effectiveness’ is usually inappropriate, except in societies where the media take a planned and deliberate role in social development. This may be true of some aspects of socialist media (see Hopkins, 1970) or of some media applications in developing countries. (Pye, 1963; Frey, 1973.) There are two main aspects to what occurs. On the one hand, there is the provision of a consistent picture of the social world which may lead the audience to adopt this version of reality, a reality of ‘facts’ and of norms, values and expectations.
- selective interaction between self and the media which plays a part in shaping the individual’s own behavior and self-concept. We learn what our social environment is and respond to the knowledge that we acquire.
	- I chose to higlight this section since I thought it was useful to understand that we could unconsciously be influenced by things such as the media it also makes me realise theat when we make our memex or as Caufield calls it his "garden" we need to try and accomadate multiple perspectives on opinionated things.
