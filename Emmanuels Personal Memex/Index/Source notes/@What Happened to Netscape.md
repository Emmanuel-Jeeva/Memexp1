## Summary 

The article "What Happened to Netscape? Here's Why The Company Failed."  provides the story of how Netscape went from one of the largest browsers to obselete. The article starts by explaining that Netscape originally had a 90% market share before microsoft started to really ramp up ways to get Internet explorer sales through anti competetive practices. The article notes that Netscape's legacy lives on in the form of Mozilla Firefox, which was created by former Netscape employees who were determined to continue the company's mission of creating an open, accessible web similar to the idea of what the internet was going to be in [[@As We May Think-Source Note]] . I believe that by highlighting the individual developers of Netscape and their vision it can show how the people behind Netscape connect to the rest of my Memex.



## Highlights
-WebRouser, UdiWWW, and Microsoft's [[Internet Explorer]] were some of Netscapes biggest competitors.Â However, despite its early success, Netscape had no real chance to beat Microsoft who released IE 1.0 soon after Netscape and continued to improve on it
- I highlighted this as it shows how tight competition between browsers was back in the day versus our modern day where the 3 main browsers microsoft edge,google chrome and safari all co exist and while they occasionaly try to innovate over each other they mostly have stayed stagnent for the past few years.
-It was also no secret that Microsoft had wanted to beat Netscape. An internal memo from May 1995, clearly outlines Microsoft CEO Bill Gates' objective to become the preferred web browser at the time.
- Its unfortunate that microsoft held a monopoly on the browser industry for a long time however it and I believe this might have caused the lack of innovation in our modern browsers
-Netscape eventually became obsolete for the most part but was, however, acquired by AOL in November 1998 for $4.2 billion.
- I believe that this showcases how important Netscape is as even when it became obselete the company was still valuable
-Netscape finally decided to outsource their code which would later give rise to Firefox.
- I highlighted this as it shows why keeping source code is important not only for preservation but for innovation.
