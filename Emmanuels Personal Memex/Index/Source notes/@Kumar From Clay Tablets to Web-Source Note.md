## Summary and Take Aways
This book discusses the growth of libraries over a log period of time staring in ancient times but mostly picking up information starting at the Roman times.

The book covers the development of libraries chronologically evtually leading to OPAC which is a very important source for information. The book covers the three functions of OPAC being: "(a) It acts as a bibliographic database or an
electronic version of the card catalogue that
it replaced, acting as an index for users in
search, for example of a particular book. As a
logical extension of this, OPAC increasingly also
provides links to electronic texts, freeing the
user from the necessity of physically locating
material on the library’s shelves.
(b) It functions as a ‘portal’ in a way not dissimilar
to a library homepage, providing links to non-
bibliographical data, either relating to users
themselves, i.e., information about overdue
books, fines, etc. or other library information
like opening hours, etc. In principle, this portal
function could be extended indefinitely to connect
to a variety of data considered to be of interest
to library users; and
(c) The OPAC functions as a promotional artifact,
advertising the presence of the library and
the services it can provide and at the same
time making a statement of authority about
communicative links that are supported and
facilitated. OPAC potentially has a fourth
function as the management of full-text data
and management of bibliographic data coverage
and the bibliographic functions of OPAC itself
become enabled for full-text searching rather than
remaining primarily an index. This technology
is not widely implemented in current OPAC
installations, but it is on the anvil and likely
to develop"

The 1990s was the start of modern systems "Library management systems witnessed further
evolution and development in the 1990s. Some
systems required to install only one manufacture’s
hardware. A variety of systems existed which
required a network to be installed and some of
the systems were not compatible with university and
other networks"

## Highlights
- While librarieshad been using COM for book form catalogueproduction and other technical service applicationssince 1960s, widespread implementation of COMcatalogues began only in the mid-1970s5. — [Updated on 2023-01-14 15:34:38](https://hyp.is/3egAjpRKEe2OgQNEiBBMiQ/d1wqtxts1xzle7.cloudfront.net/84782938/2189-libre.pdf?1650797076=&response-content-disposition=inline%3B+filename%3DFrom_Clay_Tablets_to_Web_Journey_of_Libr.pdf&Expires=1673730569&Signature=aYShb60BwzsbkmhOnL0ym3DE4f8R6~ajaaPRQHbtNBB7Ni1J993wZMhUING9mhsBmEF98g6GKTbgF~fdqH3QvR4UEKDdWYUgO7NqMSKh0RTEwlXDNILMYDbgoZHvgXx3dkHrpHo09vJHF2ZLkdMS6GjgrbZqBNSjrJ2ZzW7DuJJSmZRQjvlqhTji3dLNWBW-VfW5DkPURtdXawd4PXWBC63OfTa7dgwL696aGXVODhKYar5BaXDhH6XgGPbs4gjVGL3j5nhNi9itequ51Og99DYz~YQUL3kl~-RdYs5See7HRflJxfFj6mMm9IeggPnaV2m1I0pPTqvc7ntPDGOMSg__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAJLOHF5GGSLRBV4ZA) — Group: #hist1900c-w2023
	- Found it interesting that 1970s were the start of these new ways to catalogue with libraries

- This wasthe first attempt to achieve international co-operationin the field. The joint code was, however, perfected.During the Second World War both associations fellapart.

	- This is important in my opionion as it shows how all libraries share a certain similarity which can be both a positive and a negative.

	- start of libraries intergrating our modern tech. Only to eventually have some libraries become entirely internet based.
