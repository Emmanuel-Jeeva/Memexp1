## Summary and Take Aways

The book looks at the "broad conditions by which media and communication are  
and have been shaped.' Though presented chronologically in parts I and II, the histories  
of recorded sound and digital networking rendered here are intended to speak to one  
other. In particular, I mean to turn "The Case of Phonographs" against "The Question of  
the Web," and thereby challenge readers to imagine what a meaningful history of today's  
new media might eventually look like as well as to think about how accounts of media in  
general should be written"

Different accounts of media history will offer different things such as a "sequence of  inventors and machines, others trace the
development of ideas or epistemologies, and still others chart a changing set of social
practices, while many combine elements of several such approaches"

History has asumptions and biases towards what some consider important vs unimportant.
Gietlman talks about the media. Syas that the media is treated like an "entity". Sometimes we forget the media is plural and not singular. The book also talks about how the media treats History as if it has ended.


This book focuses on History and how we as well as different forms of media treat it. It also asks questions about whether media first and foremost is the history of technological devices or is it better looked at as history of communication.

	- I thought this was interesting as it shows how different parts of history are covered by different people.

- Naturalizing, essentializing, or ceding agency to media is something that happens at alexical level every time anyone says "the media" in English, as if media were a unified nat-ural entity, like the wind. — [Updated on 2023-01-13 15:43:29](https://hyp.is/76LYEpOCEe2OhgsNH5A53A/web.mit.edu/uricchio/Public/television/Gitelman.pdf) — Group: #Public
