Bush, Vannevar. 1945. “As We May Think.” The Atlantic. July 1, 1945. [https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1945/07/as-we-may-think/303881/](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1945/07/as-we-may-think/303881/)


## Summary and Take Aways

The article As We May Think is one that discusses many of the concepts that were eventually brought to life through the internet. Bush discusses possible ambitions and ideas all while considering the internet to be a "device" that has "exceeding speed and flexibility". In the article Bush talks about how britanica can be reduced  into the size of one desk and now in our modern age that finally became a possibility. I believe that Bush is reffering to the internet as a "medium" similarly to how mediums were discussed in class in a sense that the internet will be used to carry other things such as information.

The other concept that wasnt discussed neccecarily in the article is how some aspects of the internet didnt come true. [[Jan 16]]. Some of Bush's envisioned ideas are more or less ideas that would be used in a memex which for better or worse the modern internet is not.

## Page Notes
## Highlights
- “Consider a future device …  in which an individual stores all his books, records, and communications, and which is mechanized so that it may be consulted with exceeding speed and flexibility. It is an enlarged intimate supplement to his memory.” — [Updated on 2023-01-17 20:01:27](https://hyp.is/oy-BbpbLEe2iRjNpZXTzjA/www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1945/07/as-we-may-think/303881/) — Group: #hist1900c-w2023
	- I highlighted this since I felt it represented part of what the internet has become and therfore is significant as even before the history of the internet people 

- Science has provided the swiftest communication between individuals; it has provided a record of ideas and has enabled man to manipulate and to make extracts from that record so that knowledge evolves and endures throughout the life of a race rather than that of an individual. — [Updated on 2023-01-17 20:10:24](https://hyp.is/4w-cKJbMEe2Yaz_9KdEHnQ/www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1945/07/as-we-may-think/303881/) — Group: #hist1900c-w2023
    - Annotation: Good point. Goes with the class material of how communication has evolved over time.
- Photocells capable of seeing things in a physical sense, advanced photography which can record what is seen or even what is not, thermionic tubes capable of controlling potent forces under the guidance of less power than a mosquito uses to vibrate his wings, cathode ray tubes rendering visible an occurrence so brief that by comparison a microsecond is a long time, relay combinations which will carry out involved sequences of movements more reliably than any human operator and thousands of times as fast—there are plenty of mechanical aids with which to effect a transformation in scientific records. — [Updated on 2023-01-17 20:17:16](https://hyp.is/2JNaQJbNEe2kjh9wg5_aKQ/www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1945/07/as-we-may-think/303881/) — Group: #hist1900c-w2023
    - Annotation: All unique forms of media that are not simply writing. These have helped humanity document historical events much more efficiently
- Babbage, even with remarkably generous support for his time, could not produce his great arithmetical machine. His idea was sound enough, but construction and maintenance costs were then too heavy. — [Updated on 2023-01-17 20:25:25](https://hyp.is/-_TvKpbOEe27XYMP02OXdw/www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1945/07/as-we-may-think/303881/) — Group: #hist1900c-w2023
    - Annotation: The evolution of new forms of media is held back by human limitations
- The Encyclopædia Britannica could be reduced to the volume of a matchbox. A library of a million volumes could be compressed into one end of a desk. — [Updated on 2023-01-17 21:02:05](https://hyp.is/G0FXiJbUEe2t6GtUsP55Hw/www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1945/07/as-we-may-think/303881/) — Group: #hist1900c-w2023

- A new symbolism, probably positional, must apparently precede the reduction of mathematical transformations to machine processes.  — [Updated on 2023-01-17 21:54:48](https://hyp.is/eLdPYJbbEe2hIR-QSXxIHw/www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1945/07/as-we-may-think/303881/) — Group: #hist1900c-w2023
	- This was also predicted. Helps make me realise that we need to understand the history of the Internet it might be important to look at more aspects pre internet
