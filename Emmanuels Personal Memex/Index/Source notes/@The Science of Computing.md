## Summary
"The Science of Computing The ARPANET after Twenty Years" by Peter J. Denning is an article that discusses the ARPANET which is a precursor to the internet around 20 years after it originally was made. The article mainly discuses the concepts of packet switching, the creation of network protocols, and the need for standardization as well as how there was a initial technical struggle when trying to utilise these things. Both poitive and negative consequences of the ARPANET are discussed such as the conflics over email/faxmachines,network vulnerabilities and trust issues in terms of negative consequences and how the ARPANET led to the internet being a positive. Overall, the article highlights the significant contributions of the ARPANET to the development of computer networking and the internet, as well as the ongoing challenges and opportunities that come with such technological advancements. I believe that ARPANET falls into my memex nicely as ARPANET was developed by a group of people and shows the evolution from simple one person leading a group such as [[Alexander Graham Bell]] and Alan Turing to many people working together shaping our modern industry today.


## Highlights
-He envisioned a network to connect the centers that would be fast and robust under failures and that would work with the operating systems of the many vendors whose com  
puters were in use at the various centers. 
- I highlighted this because I believe it connects back to  [[@As We May Think-Source Note]]where the enviosioned idea of the internet doesnt end up happening

-Second, suppose we brought back Alexander Graham Bell to see our telephones. He would be littlesurprised by the design of instruments and switchingsystems?handsets, carbon microphones, dialing mechanisms, crossbar switchers, operator services, and thelike. But he would be greatly surprised by the changes inhuman practices that have grown up around the telephone?phones in every home, office, and hotel room,car phones, phone booths, international direct dialing,news services, multinational corporations, electronicfund transfers, telemarketing, ordering by phone, fax,telephone pornography, and much more. 
- I highlighted this because it brings back [[Alexander Graham Bell]] and highlights how although the vision he wanted the phone to become was not followed through with he still would hopefully be proud of how the phone has evolved today

-Although electronic mail was not among the earlygoals of the Arpanet, by 1971 mail accounted for most ofthe traffic, and most users thought of the network as away of communicating with colleagues, a tool supporting collaboration.
- Its interesting find out that this was pretty much how email became a thing and how it was originally just a simple tool but a lot like the telephone and the internet itself the vision changed.

-In 1967 he persuaded  Roberts to come to arpa and head the network project. Roberts presented a detailed proposal forthe network at the first symposium on operating systems
- I highlighted this since it shows that ARPANET is made by multiple people and not just one. 
- Also shows the impact of [[Lawrence Roberts]]
