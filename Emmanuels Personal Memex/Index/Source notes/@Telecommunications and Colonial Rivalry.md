## Summary
In this article the first telegraphic cable to link the Spainish mainland and Canary Islands is discussed as well as what ends up happening to this cable. This cable was originally exploited by the english and french as a way to assert colonial dominance with evetually germans doing the same thing. Many wetsern powers fought over ower ship of these cables as they were vital for certain imperialist projects. Quevado mainly talks about the role of the telegraph/cables in Europian colonial power on the Canary islands. I believe that this article was an important source as it relates back to my memex main theme of the impact on/of people on technology. The article highlights the negatives of how the telegraph was an incentive for colonizers to take advantage of groups of people and their land.
