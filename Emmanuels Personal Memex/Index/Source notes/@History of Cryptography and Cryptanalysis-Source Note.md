## Summary and Take Aways
"Cryptology is the science of secret writing. It is made up of two halves; cryptography consists of the techniques for creating systems of secret writing[[Cryptology and Cryptography + the Internet]] and cryptanalysis encompasses the techniques of breaking them."

The reading talks about cryptology and its history. It starts by discussing how the military,government and people in buisness always try to keep their writing secret ever since they started writing. However unlike ohter forms of secret writing what makes cryptology so unique is that they dont hide the precesnce of a secret message but rather they make the message impossible to read to the averag person. The reading then talks about how cryptoanalysts try to look at the science of cryptography.

The second half of the reading talks about codes and ciphers. A code will take the form of a book where numerical or alphabetical codeword is switched with words or phrases. [[Commercial codes]] are used by telegraphy companies in the 19th and 20th century. Cryptoanalyzing these codes is difficult since often theres no logical connection between the codeword and the plaintext it represents.  In many cases where codes are used, the encoded message is then also enciphered so the codewords are enciphered when the message is transmitted which is known as [[superencipherment]]. Ciphers also transform plaintext into ciphertext, but unlike codes, ciphers use small, xed-length language elements that are divorced from the meaning of the word or phrase in the message. There are two types of cyphers.[[Substitution ciphers ]] will replace each letter in a message with a different letter or symbol using a mapping called a cipher alphabet. The second type will rearrange the letters of a message, but will not substitute new letters for the existing letters in the message. These are [[transposition ciphers.]]





## Page Notes
## Highlights
-  computing, with an emphasis on the ‘externalist’ view of this history, more accessible to a wider audience. The series examines content and history from four main quadrants: the his — [Updated on 2023-01-26 20:49:45](https://hyp.is/4Cm2jJ3kEe2-q0MwkWZQ6w/books-scholarsportal-info.proxy.library.carleton.ca/en/read?id=/ebooks/ebooks4/springer4/2019-06-27/1/9783319904436) — Group: #hist1900c-w2023
	- the reason I highlighted is because it talks about making the history accessible to others which is something that I have considered important as the easier it is to learn,study and preserve history.
