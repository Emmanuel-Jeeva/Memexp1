I’m a pretty standard issue liberal and when I see things that support my liberal views I tend to notice them.-Relates back to class. Does the media occasionaly try and exploit our own beliefs/views for importance or to gain power?[[@Media Effects-Source Note]]

"So when I see an article like this I think — Wow, I don’t have much in my wiki about gun control, this seems like a good start to build it out and I make a page."-This relates back to Obsidian and using it to build our own pages

"I wander away from it for a bit. I go and get my coffee and make sure the kids are getting ready for school. When I come back I see this page and I think, you know what would make this page better? A link to the actual study. So  I spend a couple more minutes and track down the actual paper and add it."-Taking a break can sometimes help which was discussed durng lectures and on discord

"The Garden is the web as topology. The web as space. It’s the integrative web, the iterative web, the web as an arrangement and rearrangement of things to one another."
"The architect creates the bridge, but it is the visitors to the park who create the bridge’s meaning. A good bridge supports many approaches, many views, many seasons, maybe many uses, and the meaning of that bridge will even evolve for the architect over time."
"The Stream is a newer metaphor with old roots. We can think of the”event stream” of programming, the “lifestream” proposed by researchers in the 1990s."
" to link, annotate, change, summarize, copy, and share — these are the verbs of gardening."

"Our traditional binary here is “open vs. closed”. But honestly that’s not the most interesting question to me anymore. I know why textbook companies are closed. They want to make money."-makes you wonder if this will change in the future if textbook sales go down or some other  trend change happens.
