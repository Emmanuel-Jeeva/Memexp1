> It suggested that in theory, it ought to be possible to harness electricity tobuild a signaling device capable of sending messages over great distancesincomparably faster than a human messenger could carry them.

Perhaps the best-known description of the sympathetic needles waspublished by Famianus Strada, a learned Italian who provided a detailedexplanation in his book Prolusiones Academicae, published in 1617. Hewrote of "a species of lodestone which possesses such virtue, that if twoneedles be touched with it, and then balanced on separate pivots, and theone turned in a particular direction, the other will sympathetically moveparallel to it." Each needle, he explained, was to be mounted in the centerof a dial, with the letters of the alphabet written around its edge.

> The story of the needles was based on a germ of truth: There are indeednaturally occurring minerals, known as lodestones, which can be used tomagnetize needles and other metallic objects. And if two magnets are placedon pivots very close together, moving one will indeed cause the other tomove in response, as a result of the interaction of their magnetic fields. Butit is not the case that the two magnets will always remain parallel, and theeffect is only noticeable when they are right next to each other.

-I highligted this because it shows how a lot of old stories have hidden truths

If a message could be passed along a network of three towers successfully, thesystem would obviously work with a larger number of towers over greaterdistances. Following the Chappe brothers' run-in with the Paris mob, themayors of each of the three towns were made responsible for the safety ofthe telegraphs and their operators.

> THE TELEGRAPH SYSTEM was rightly regarded as a technologicalwonder of its time. An entry in the 1797 edition of the EncyclopaediaBritannica strikes a note of technological optimism that sounds familiartoday: "The capitals of distant nations might be united by chains of posts,and the settling of those disputes which at present take up months or yearsmight then be accomplished in as many hours."

-I highlighted this because I found it Interesting how now Britannica is sow entirely on the internet wheras before it was used to report on the progress that would lead towards the internet

> He faced increasing criticism from rival inventors, who claimed eitherto have invented superior forms of telegraph or to have had the idea for thetelegraph before him. Even his former associate, the clock maker Breguet,turned against him and claimed to have contributed far more to Chappe'sdesign than simply the control mechanism.

-Highlighted because it Relates back to the lecture when Dr.Graham talked about how women probably are not given enough credit for what they have done in terms of creating the internet.


The earliest suggestion of a scheme for using electricity to send messageshad appeared in the Scots' Magazine of February 17, 1753

> One example of a working electric telegraph was constructed in 1816 by atwenty-eight-year-old Englishman, Francis Ronalds. Similar to Chappe'soriginal design, it involved synchronized clocks whose dials were markedwith letters, rather like the dials supposedly used with the sympatheticneedles. Instead of hands, each clock had a rotating disk with a notch cutinto it so that only one of the letters on the dial was visible at any time.

> uLTIMATELY, the success of the optical telegraph designs inspired byChappe was limited because they were so expensive to run.

-highlighted because it Goes back to the [[@The Rise and The Fall of the Fax Machine]] where it was stated that the tech can roll out faster if it is more economically viable.
