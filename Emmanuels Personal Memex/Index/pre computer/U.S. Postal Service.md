- In 1775, before the Declaration of Independence was even signed, the Continental Congress turned the Constitutional Post into the Post Office of the United States, whose operations became the first—and for many citizens, the most consequential—function of the new government itself. — [Updated on 2023-03-10 16:53:56](https://hyp.is/Djlnlr-OEe2_DjuXXMM0yQ/www.smithsonianmag.com/smithsonian-institution/brief-history-united-states-postal-service-180975627/) — Group: #hist1900c-w2023
	- I highlighted this because I felt it connects back to [[@Media Effects-Source Note]] where in a sense the post office is considered the medium and is able to convey messages as well as influence individuals.

- An early instance (circa 1910) of a Rural Free Delivery carrier using an automobile to reach the addresses on his far-flung route. “As the frontier moved westward, the Post Office followed, connecting scattered settlements and territories to the rest of the country and the world,” says Piazza. — [Updated on 2023-03-10 16:54:39](https://hyp.is/J-bqJL-OEe24ais4Hq--tg/www.smithsonianmag.com/smithsonian-institution/brief-history-united-states-postal-service-180975627/) — Group: #hist1900c-w2023
	- Shows how much the telephone and telegraph will help make communication much easier for those who can afford it/ can use them



- The post continued to subsidize the nation’s transportation infrastructure. In the East, railroads replaced mounted couriers and stagecoaches. To connect the coasts, the department first financed steamships to carry the mail through the Isthmus of Panama. Then it invested in stagecoaches, which sped the mail from Missouri and Tennessee, where the railroads stopped, to California, enabling vital communications during the gold rush. In 1869, the great transcontinental railroad was completed. The mail was a lifeline connecting Western settlers with loved ones back home.
	- Relates to [[@Telecommunications and Colonial Rivalry]] where in order to establish a form of technology as the dominant technology companies had to either innovate or take up parts of land with their creations(in this case a railroad) in order to make their product viable.

>- The boom after World War II doubled the volume of mail even as the cash-starved department racked up big deficits and faced a fiscal crisis recalling that of the 1840s. Alarmed, Congress in 1970 remade the department into the United States Postal Service
>	- Goes to show how the war caused lots of innovation and drove the economy at a horrible cost that wasnt worth it in my opionion
>	- linking to Eric Desrosiers Memex where he said "Was the fracturing of the world during the world wars the cause of all this joint standardization and corodination on the global scale?"- I now ask this same question as it seems the war made certain things such as the post office a standard https://glng3r.github.io/memex/
