The laying of the telegraph cable is regarded, and mostjustly, as the greatest event in the present century; now the great work iscomplete, the whole earth will be belted with electric current, palpitatingwith human thoughts and emotions.
- I highlighted this because I felt that it related to [[@The Peoples Network]] where the telephone was being created as a telegraph for the perople and yet here the telegraph was still celebrated by some people but clearly wasnt given the ability for its full capability to be shown


The Atlantic Telegraph has half undone theDeclaration of 1776, and has gone far to make us once again, in spite ofourselves, one people." A popular slogan suggested that the effect of theelectric telegraph would be to "make muskets into candlesticks." Indeed, theconstruction of a global telegraph network was widely expected, by Briggsand Maverick among others, to result in world peace
- I highlighted this since I felt it shows how people believed certain forms of technology would be used to bring world peace not thinking about the possible reprecussions of those forms of technolgy

In a bid tosilence the skeptics, the full transcript of the messages sent over the cablebefore it failed was released
- I think that showing and not telling approach is a smart one on their end and im surprised to not see it pop up in other readings such as [[Caufield]] where we get a nice descrition of building hypotethical garden but are not shown what it should look like.

> For several months the committee tookevidence from witnesses, both expert and not-so-expert, in an attempt to getto the bottom of the problem of longdistance submarine telegraphy.
> - I think it is good to get evidence from a variety of sources whenever trying to make something

THE NEW CABLE was built with a lot more care than its predecessor.Following Professor Thomson's recommendations, it had a much largerconducting core; it was also more buoyant, so it would be less likely tosnap under its own weight. Still, it was so heavy that there was only oneship in the world that would be able to carry it: the Great Eastern,designed by Isambard Kingdom Brunei, and easily the largest ship afloat
- I think that this relates back to when in [[@The Rise and The Fall of the Fax Machine]] the concept of if a piece of technology is too expensive or too inconvienient to use then it wont be as popular. Here in this case they still hadnt perfected the new cable and so not only were they unable to move the cable but eventually they got a better cable which helped make the telegraph more popular
