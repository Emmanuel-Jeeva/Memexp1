While taking the course I believe that I have gone on a journey that has helped me to learn my answer to this exact question. I believe that my journey starting at the [[@As We May Think-Source Note]] was the start of this. With this we got to learn about ideas and concepts that could have been made possible throught the internet. While I initialy simply looked at this reading at its face value I believe now that it shows the emergence of the modern concept of cutting content or ideas which is something programers and people of work in other fields have to deal with. Whether an idea may be not feasible, too difficult, too controverial or not popular enough there are many reasons why things may be changed or downsized especially within the computer science industry where certain programs,applications or pieces of entertainment end up with less features or imporvments over time.  

The next part of this journey was the [[@The Science of Computing]] article which I recently got to read through. Within this article I learned about ARPANET which I believe to be importnent as they programmed what was essentially the template for the internet we now know today. By learning about this I was able to expand my own ideas of what computer science is useful for as I previously only looked at programming things such as software,computers and security versus what the people at ARPANET were able to do by programming the entire precursor to the internet. Thanks to this newfound knowledge  I now know the roots of networking and who started programming what essentially was the internet.

My journey then reflects back on Alexander Grahm Bell. Throughout this course and especially within the second and third memex check in's I looked at people who influecned the history of the internet as well as the world in some major way and one of these figures was Alexander Graham Bell.  Alexander Graham Bell has shown me the importance of the technology that came before the internet and how it shaped our modern culture. It also showed me how even back then people wanted to create accesible technology which is a goal of many companies/ programmers today as it allows more people to use whatever you or your team creates. 

The last article that was part of my journey was the impact of Alan Turing which I believe had been able to help me come to the end of my journey over these four months. Alan turing was essentially the father of computer science and his dedication to the field helped change the war. Alan Turing helped me to understand how computer science can help people and change lives as well as helped educate me on the roots for computer science. I believe that his story also helped complete my memex as it helped add another important individual to my memex and helped centralise my theme of people and their impact on both the internet and the world.

In conclusion my journey across this semester from [[@As We May Think-Source Note]] all the way to [[@The Impact of Alan Turing]] was able to help me learn more about the history of computer science, its origins as well as how plans for certain projects can change over time. I believe that this journey has helped me to now have a firm understanding of how important computer science is and how it can be used to make a positive difference in the world by making more accessible technology.
